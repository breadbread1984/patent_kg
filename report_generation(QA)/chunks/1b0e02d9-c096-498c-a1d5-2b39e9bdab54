Formamidinium iodide (FAI), Ethylenediamine iodine (EDADI), Cuo, bathocuproine (BCP), and poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) are purchased from Xi\u2019an Polymer Light Technology Corporation (China, http://www.p-oled.cn/). Tin powder, Dimethyl! sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.9%), Dimethyl formamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.9%), and Chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.8%) are purchased from TCI (TCI Worldwide Headquarters-TOKYO CHEMICAL INDUS- TRY CO., LTD., Chuo-ku, Tokyo, https://Awww.tcichemi- cals.com/HK/en/). All these materials in experiments are used as received without any further purification.\n\n[0143] The materials and device performance are charac- terized according to the following methods.\n\n[0144] The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis.) absorptions are measured by a UV-vis. spectrometer (PerkinElmermodel Lambda 2S, SpectraLab Scientific Inc., Markham, Canada, https://www.spectralabsci.com/equipment/perkin-elmer-uv- vis-spectrometer-lambda-2s/). UV-vis measurement is per- formed at room temperature with humidity 40-50%. The perovskite thin film samples are deposited on 1.5 emx1.5 cm ITO for testing. A wavelength ranging from 300 to 900 nm is applied.\n\n[0145] The surface-view morphologies are characterized by SEM (QUATTROS, Thermal Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA, https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ QUATTROESEM). SEM measurement is performed at vacuum with pressure lower than 2 torr. The perovskite thin film samples are deposited on ITO and cut to 0.5 cmx0.5 cm for testing. No gold spray treatment is carried out before the measurement. An Electron beam with 10 kV is applied.", "type": "Document"}}
