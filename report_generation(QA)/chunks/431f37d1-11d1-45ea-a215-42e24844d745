The RhCl, solution was then added to the thiourea solution slowly under stirring until the clear transparent solution was obtained. The mix- ture solution was sealed into a 35 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave reactor, which was next heated at 140\u00b0 C. for 12 hours in an electric oven. After cooling the system to room temperature naturally, the brown precipitates were gathered and washed several times with ethanol and deion- ized water by centrifugation, followed by vacuum dried at 60\u00b0 C. overnight. Finally, the Rh,;/NSC yolk-shell nano- structures (Rh,,/NSC YSS) were transformed from brown precipitates by a heat treatment method in air atmosphere at 450\u00b0 C. for 6 hours with a heating rate of 2\u00b0 C. min- (FIG. 1).\n\n[0071] For comparison, other Rh,/NSC YSS (x=5, 10, 20 and 30) were also prepared as control samples using the same methods except for changing the feeding amount of RhCl, for 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively.\n\nExample 2\u2014Assessment of the Crystallinity and Structure of Rh, ,/NSC YSS\n\n[0072] The purity and crystalline structure of prepared samples were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a scan rate of 0.05\u00b0 s~! in a 20 scan ranging from 20\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 using a Bruker D2 Phaser (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) instrument equipped with a monochromatic Cu-Ka radiation.\n\n[0073] Referring to FIG. 2, as illustrated in the XRD pattern, the crystallographic structure of the obtained Rhis/ NSC YSS could be matched well with the standard pattern of cubic Rh phase (ICPDS NO. 87-0714). When combined with FT-IR spectra, it can be seen that the sharp peak around. 611 cm\u2122! is caused by Rh\u2014S(O), indicating the strong electronic effect between Rh and S, N co-doped carbon.", "type": "Document"}}
