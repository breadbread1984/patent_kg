Unless otherwise defined, all other technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs.\n\n[0062] In order to address the objectives and needs dis- cussed above, the present invention provides a yolk-shell nanostructure with Rh nanoparticles embedded in S, N co-doped carbon nanostructures for efficient hydrogen evo- lution reactions. The preparation process of the Rh,/NSC YSS (x=5, 10, 15, 20, or 30) is conducted with a self- template method. The Rh/NSC YSS precursor is first obtained with the nanostructure through a facile hydrother- mal method by using RhCl and thiourea as the Rh, N, S and C sources. Then, the precursor is in-situ transformed into Rh/NSC YSS nanostructure by a heat treatment in air atmosphere.\n\n[0063] The obtained nanostructures can achieve an over- potential of 10-20 mV at 10 mA cm\u201d, a Tafel slope of 20-30 mV dec\u2122', high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.1-0.3 s~! (at -75 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), and long-term durability for more than 10 hours, which is the record-high alkaline HER activity among the ever-reported noble metal- based catalysts.\n\n[0064] Preferably, the obtained nanostructures has an overpotential of 13.5 mV at 10 mA cm~?, a Tafel slope of 25.5 mV dec\", high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.143 s~* (at -75 m V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode).\n\n[0065] In some embodiments, the yolk-shell nanostructure has a particle size of 1-300 nm, more particularly, 30-250 mm. The water contact angle is between 10 to 40 degrees, more particularly, between 10 to 20 degrees. A thickness of the yolk-shell nanostructure may be in the range of 1 to 10 nm.", "type": "Document"}}
