However, the perceived toxicity of lead in the state-of-the-art perov- skite solar cells (PVSCs) remains an issue that must be addressed on the path towards commercialization. As an alternative to lead halide perovskites, tin perovskites out- perform other lead-free perovskite candidates due to a avorable band gap, low exciton-bind energy, and high carrier mobility. Despite the rapid development of tin VSCs, there is still a substantial efficiency difference between tin and lead perovskite photovoltaics, leading to a massive energy loss. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective strategies to reduce the energy loss of environment- friendly tin PVSCs.\n\n[0004] Long-term stability of tin PVSCs is another chal- lenging issue to the commercialization. As such, it is desir- able to develop new tin PVSCs with both improved PCE and stability.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a tin-based perovskite solar cell (PVSC) including a surface treatment layer containing a functionalized fullerene deriva- tive having a structure of formula I below:\n\nFormula I\n\nFormula I\n\n[0006] in which R is a monocyclic or polycyclic aro- matic ring including one or two nitrogen atoms.\n\n[0007] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing a tin-based PVSC including the steps of:\n\n[0008] providing a substrate;\n\n[0009] coating a hole transport layer onto the substrate;\n\nand\n\nJun. 6, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
