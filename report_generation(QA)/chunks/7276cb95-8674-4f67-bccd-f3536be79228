An apparatus for facilitating a photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel, comprising:\n\na switch connected in parallel with the photovoltaic device and configured for driving the photovoltaic device to produce optical signals carrying sensed data to be transmitted; and\n\na control module connected with the switch and config- ured for receiving electrical sensing signals and gen- erate a control signal to control the switch.\n\n2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein:\n\nwhen the control signal has a high-level value represent- ing a logical value of \u201c1\u201d, the switch is controlled to be at a close state for conducting current; and\n\nwhen the control signal has a low-level value representing a logical value of \u201c0\u201d, the switch is controlled to be an open state for blocking current.\n\n3. The apparatus according to claim 1, w module comprises a memory configured erein the control for:\n\nreceiving a parameter sensing signal carrying the sensed data to be transmitted; and\n\nrecording the sensed data.\n\n4. The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the control module further comprises a state machine configured for:\n\nreceiving a current sensing signal for indicating a direc- tion of an electrical current flowing through the pho- tovoltaic device for determining whether the photovol- taic device is operated in a generative mode or a diagnosis mode;\n\nreceiving a voltage sensing signal provided for indicating a change in a voltage across the photovoltaic device in response to illumination by an artificial light when the photovoltaic device is operated in a diagnostics mode; and\n\ngenerating a transmission enabling signal based on the current sensing signal and the voltage sensing signal.\n\nUS 11,671,731 B2\n\n7\n\n8\n\n5.
