Effects of Ceo-BPy modification\n\n[0161] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to track the changes in the binding energy of the perovskite films with and without Ceo-BPy modification (i.e., after and before the step of depositing the C,,.-BPy interface layer as described above). In FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the binding energies corresponding to the Sn 3d and I 3d core levels of the Cao-BPy treated perovskite films shift marginally to lower values as compared to the control sample, indicating improved binding of both anions and cations on the perov- skite surface, which may be related to the strong binding between the perovskite surface ions and Ceo-BPy.\n\n[0162] Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is further performed to study the change of the characteristic peaks for Ceo-BPy molecule before and after depositing on perovskite films (FIG. 8). The C\u2014N bond in the pyridine group displayed stretching vibration at 1638 cm\u2122' for pris- tine Cgo-BPy, whereas shifted to 1627 cm for Cgo-BPy modified perovskite films. Except for the C\u2014N vibration, there is no discernible change in the other characteristic peaks.\n\n[0163] The XPS and FTIR results confirm that the pyri- dine unit in Coo-BPy as a Lewis base is able to combine with Sn ions in perovskite with a formation of Sn\u2014N bonding.\n\n[0164] In addition, the XRD patterns in FIG. 9 indicate that the crystal structure of the perovskite film does not change after Ceo-BPy modification, which shows no reac- tion of producing any impurity.", "type": "Document"}}
