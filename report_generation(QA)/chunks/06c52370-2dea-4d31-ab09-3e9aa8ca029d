FIG. 2F shows that the single-cell encapsulation efliciency is able to reach approximately 47.8%, while the multiple-cell encapsulation ratio is sup- pressed to approximately 5.9% at a situation while using cell concentration of 0.85x107 cell/mL and a cell suspension flow rate of 300 uL/30 mins (the flow rate of isolated mitochondria suspension was maintained to be the same). This implies that the single-to-multiple cell encapsulation ratio is increased to 8.1. In other words, 292% of the Poisson distribution (at the condition of cells encapsulated per drop- let was 0.6). Such improvement in single-cell encapsulation efficiency is able to help increase the throughput. The proposed system is able to notably yield 2x10 recipient cells in droplets for mitochondria transfer in 30 minutes. As shown in FIG. 2H, the mitochondrial transfer efficiency, defined as the ratio of the isolated mitochondria transferred into the cell to the total isolated mitochondria encapsulated. in the droplet, decreased slightly from 75% to 70% with the increase in droplet diameter from 40 hm to 52 um. As shown, in FIG. 2G, the droplet diameter is set to 40 hm by setting the flow rate ratio of oil/water phase to 6. As shown in FIG. 2I, after processing with the developed system, the viability\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\nof the recipient cells can still be kept relatively high, such as 95% at a flow rate of 300 uL/30 mins.", "type": "Document"}}
