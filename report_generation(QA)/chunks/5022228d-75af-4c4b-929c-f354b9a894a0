In some embodiments, the substrate includes a material selected from the group of ITO/Glass, ITO/PEN, ITO/PET, FTO/Glass, FTO/PEN, FTO/PET, and a combi- nation thereof. In an embodiment herein, the substrate is preferably ITO. Compared with PEN and PET, ITO sub- strate has higher transmittance and higher device efficiency. Compared with FTO, it is believed that ITO-based devices are thinner and lighter, making it easier to transport and install.\n\nPerovskite Layer\n\n[0076] In some embodiments, the perovskite solar cell includes a perovskite layer, which is the active or functional layer of the solar cell. In other words, the perovskite layer is the light-absorbing layer of the solar cell. The term light- absorbing\u2019 in relation to the perovskite(s) (and by extension the perovskite layer 30 comprising one or more perovskites) refers to its role in absorbing light, e.g. visible light, so as to act as a light absorbing material which allows to convert the light into electrical energy. A perovskite type compound exhibits strong absorption with respect to visible light inci- dent on the solar cell, and the bandgap of a perovskite semiconductor can be tuned to a desired band gap energy (Eg), thereby improving the efficiency of such solar cells.", "type": "Document"}}
