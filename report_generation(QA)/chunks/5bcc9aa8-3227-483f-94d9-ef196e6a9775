The two suspensions are mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell suspension and isolated mitochondria suspen- sion. A wave-like structure is adapted to focus the randomly distributed cells from the inlet to a line as shown FIG. 1D. Thus, the single-cell encapsulation efficiency can be improved. The isolated mitochondria are taken up by the recipient C2C12 cells via endocytosis inside the droplets, as indicated in FIG. 1E. The droplet generation and observation modules are connected via a PE tubing (BD Intramedic\u2122, BD 427406), and the whole fabricated chip is only approxi- mately 8 cm in length as shown in FIG. 1F. After mitochon- drial transfer is completed, the recipient cells are collected from the droplets via a droplet rupture process, and func- tional experiments could be immediately performed to assess the effect of mitochondrial transfer at different num- bers on C2C12 cell myogenic differentiation in-vitro, as indicated in FIG. 1G.\n\n[0047] For the observation and 3D rebuilding under a confocal fluorescence microscope (LEICA SP8LIA++ TRUE Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope), MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM (Invitrogen\u2122, M7514) at a con- centration of 2 uM is used to stain the mitochondria before isolation from donor cells.\n\n[0048] As presented in FIGS. 2A-2C, after mitochondria isolation, the mitochondria recipient cells and the freshly isolated mitochondria are loaded into the microfluidic chip immediately for the encapsulation and mitochondrial trans- fer process. The labelled isolated mitochondria in suspen- sion are spherical-like structures with a diameter of around 1 hm as shown in FIG. 2D. After 2 hours of co-culture in the generated droplets, FIG. 2E shows that the isolated mito- chondria are taken up by the recipient cells via endocytosis.", "type": "Document"}}
