(prefer- ably 80\u00b0 C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere for about 5 h; and\n\n[0061] removing the solution.\n\n[0062] Without being bonding to theory, it is believed that the materials synthesized within the above-mentioned parameters have higher purity and better stability. If the ratio of N-butyl glycine to Coo does not conform to 2:1, it will lead to the increase of impurities and the decrease of synthesis yield. If the material concentration is too high or the mixture is heated at a higher temperature than the above, the reaction rate may be too fast, resulting in agglomeration of the synthesis product, which is not conducive to later use.\n\n[0063] In some embodiments, the precursor compound is selected from the group of n-butyl-pyridine, 4-pyridinecar- boxaldehyde, nicotinaldehyde, pyrazine-2-carbaldehyde, 5-methylpyrazine-2-carbaldehyde, quinoline-8-carbalde- hyde, is oquinoline-8-carbaldehyde, quinoline-4-carbalde- hyde, quinoline-5-carbaldehyde, quinoline-7-carbaldehyde,\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nguinoline-3-carbaldehyde, quinoline-6-carbaldehyde, 1,8- naphthyridine-4-carbaldehyde, and 1,8-naphthyridine-3-car- baldehyde. In an embodiment herein, the precursor com- pound is preferably n-butyl-pyridine.", "type": "Document"}}
