For comparison, the data collected on Rh,/NSC YSS, RhswNSC YSS, commercial 20% Pt/C and commer- cial 5% Rh/C (C\u2014Rh/C) were also included. Table 1 summarized the overpotential and Tafel Slope of various electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Among these five samples, Rh,;/NSC YSS exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance in the 1M KOH electrolyte (pH=14), with the lowest overpotential (13.5 mV at 10 mA cm7) and Tafel slope (24.9 mV dec\u2122'), which was better than those of commercial 20% Pt/C and outperforming the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts (FIGS. 8A and 8B). Referring to FIG. 8C, Rh, ./NSC YSS achieved the highest TOF of 0.143 s7' at the overpotential of 75 mV, which was also larger than those of Pt/C (0.131 s- and C \u4e00 Rh/C (0.075 s\u201c*).\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nTABLE 1\n\nElectrocatalytic performance comparison between Rh,/NSC YSS (x =", "type": "Document"}}
