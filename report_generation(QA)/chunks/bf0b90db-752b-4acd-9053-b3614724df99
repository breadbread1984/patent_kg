Up until now, platinum (Pt)-based nanomaterials have served as the most effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reac- tion (HER) due to their hydrogen adsorption free energy (AG;,) being close to zero, requiring only a small overpo- tential to produce hydrogen. However, the poor stability and unsatisfactory performance of Pt in non-acidic conditions greatly hinders its widespread practical application. For example, the HER kinetics of Pt in alkaline solutions is about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic conditions.\n\n[0003] Because of different requirements in different elec- trolyzer systems (e.g., acidic media for poton-exchange membrane-based water electrolyzers, near-neutral media for microbial electrolysis cells and alkaline medium for alkaline electrolyzers), as well as the intense local pH change on the electrode surface during reaction, an effective HER electro- catalyst must perform well over a wide pH range. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop pH-uni- versal electrocatalysts with high electrochemical perfor- mance and robust stability, even in terms of the current density calculated based on geometric surface (electrode surface area), very few of them can achieve comparable activities to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. In this regard, it is still challenging to develop pH-universal electrocata- lysts with HER activities and stability that exceed those of commercial Pt/C materials.", "type": "Document"}}
