FIG. 5A shows the representative brightfield images of mitochondrial transferred C2C12 cells during myogenic induction process. C2C12 cells were subjected to mitochondrial transfer at different concentrations before myogenic induction (8, 14, and 31 exogenous isolated mitochondria transferred per cell were defined as low-mito, middle-mito and high-mito transferred group, respectively). Cell morphology and formed myotubes were imaged right before induction started and on days 3 and 7 of induction process. FIGS. 5B-5C shows on day 7, myotube area and length were determined by ImageJ, and three FOVs were taken per well. FIG. 5D shows the cellular proliferation of C2C12 cells was determined by MTT assay on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 post mitochondrial transfer. All the values were normalized to day 0. Data were presented as mean+SD and analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn\u2019s mul-\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\ntiple comparison test, N=3. * (or #) p<0.05, ** (or ##) p<0.01, *** (or ###) p<0.001, and **** (or #####) p<0.0001.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION", "type": "Document"}}
