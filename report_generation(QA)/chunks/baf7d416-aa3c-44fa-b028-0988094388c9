The method involves precipitating the nanomaterials followed by heat treatment. In a first aspect, a rhodium salt such as RhCl: is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as water. A separate thiourea solution is formed; similarly, the thiourea may use water as the solvent. and thiourea in distilled water sepa- rately to form a RhC1, solution and a thiourea solution\n\n[0067] The rhodium salt solution is slowly added to the thiourea solution with agitation to obtain a transparent mixture. A hydrothermal reaction is performed on the mix- ture, followed by cooling to room temperature, causing the formation of precipitates. The precipitates are recovered and. washed, followed by drying for at least approximately 12 hours, preferably under vacuum conditions. The precipi- tates, which typically exhibit a brown color, a transformed into a yolk-shell nanostructure through heat treatment in the ambient atmosphere.\n\n[0068] In one aspect, the mass ratio between RhCl, and thiourea is in a range of 15:1 to 2:1 and the temperature\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nduring the hydrothermal reaction is in a range of 120\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C. The time of the hydrothermal reaction is in a range of 1 to 48 hours.\n\n[0069] In one embodiment, the drying of the precipitates may be overnight and under vacuum at a temperature of approximately 50\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. The heat treatment may occur at a temperature of approximately 300\u00b0 C. to 800\u00b0 C. and for a time of 1 to 48 hours. To reach the final heat treatment temperature, the temperature may increase at a rate of approximately 2\u00b0 C. min@' until the final heat treatment temperature is reached.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1\u2014Fabrication of Rh, ,/NSC Yolk-Shell Nanostructures (Rh, ;/NSC YSS)", "type": "Document"}}
