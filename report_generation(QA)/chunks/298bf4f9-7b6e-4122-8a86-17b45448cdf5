N-type doping will tend to increase the n-type character of the semiconductor material, while p-type doping will tend to reduce the degree of the natural n-type state (e.g. due to defects). Such doping may be made with any suitable material including F, Sb, N, Ge, Si, C, In, InO and/or Al. Suitable dopants and doping levels will be evident to those of skill in the art.\n\n[0080] In some embodiments, the light-absorbing perov- skite layer comprises one or more metal halide perovskites. For example, the metal halide perovskites may have a structure of ABX,, where the A-site ions can be selected from the group of FA*, MA\u2018, Cs*, and Rb*, and B-site ions can be selected from the group of Pb?*, Sn?*, Bi*, and Ag*, and X-site ions can be selected from the group of F-, Cl\u2019, Br\u2019, and I-. In some examples, the light-absorbing perov- skite layer may comprise two different metal halide perov- skites configured to form a semiconductor heterojunction within the perovskite layer. Any perovskite capable of performing the desired light-absorbing and charge separa- tion functions may be used in the light-absorbing perovskite layer.\n\nHole Transport Layer (HTL)\n\n[0081] In some embodiment, the solar cell may further includes a hole transport layer (i.e., p-type charge-extraction layer) comprising or consisting of one or more hole transport materials. In an inverted PVSC, for example, as shown in FIG. 5a, the HTL (the hole transport layer 20) is located proximate to the transparent substrate 10 (holes are collected at the electrode proximate the substrate, converse to the conventional PVSC).", "type": "Document"}}
