Example hole transport materials include but is not limited to organic hole-transport materials, inorganic hole-transport materials or combinations thereof. Organic hole-transport materials may be polymeric or non- polymeric. Exemplary polymeric hole-transport materials include polythiophenes, for example poly (3-hexylthi- ophene) (P3HT); p oly (arylamines) for example Poly [bis (4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA); \u2014 and doped PEDOT, for example Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio- phene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Exemplary non-polymeric organic hole-transport materials are com- pounds containing one or more arylamine groups, for example spiro-OMeTAD. Examplary inorganic hole-trans- port materials include copper-based materials (e.g. Cuac, CuSCN, Cul, etc.), nickel-based materials (e.g. NiO,), two- dimensional layered materials such as chalcogens (e.g. MoS;, WS,, etc.). Hole transport materials encourage a flow of holes from the p-type perovskite, away from the junction within the perovskite layer, while block the movement of electrons.\n\n[0083] In some embodiments, the hole transport layer includes a material selected from the group of PEDOT:PSS, PTAA, and a combination thereof. It is believed that, these materials with excellent hole transport ability are also mature commercial hole transport materials, and therefore are readily available for industrial production.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nElectron Transport Layer (ETL)", "type": "Document"}}
