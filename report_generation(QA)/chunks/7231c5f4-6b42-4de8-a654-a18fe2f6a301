In some embodiments, R is not pyridine. In an embodiment herein, the monocyclic aromatic ring is preferably pyridine because it can form strong binding with Pb ions in perovskite, which can pas- sivate Pb related defects.\n\n[0055] In some embodiments, R in Formula I is a poly- cyclic aromatic ring selected from the group of isoquinoline, naphthyridine, and a combination thereof.\n\n[0056] In some embodiments, the functionalized fullerene derivative has a structure selected from the group of:\n\na)\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\n-continued\n\nQ)\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n(G3)\n\n(6)\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n-continued\n\na)\n\n(8)\n\n@)\n\n(10)\n\nUD\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\ncontinued\n\nan > and\n\n(13)\n\n[0057] In some embodiments, the functionalized fullerene derivative has a structure selected from any of formulae (3) to (13) as listed above.

Pyridine can better combine fullerene molecules with tin-based perovskites and improve their mutual binding force. Furthermore, it is believed that long alkyl chains can increase the robustness of perovskite films, thereby improving device reliability.", "type": "Document"}}
