Preferably, the yolk-shell nanostructure has a particle size of 30-250 nm.\n\n[0011] Ina second embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the yolk-shell nanostructure has a water contact angle between 10 degrees to 40 degrees. Preferably, the yolk-shell nanostructure has a water contact angle between 10 degrees to 20 degrees.\n\n[0012] In a third embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention, the thickness of the yolk-shell nanostruc- ture is in a range of 1 to 10 nm.\n\n[0013] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for fabricating a yolk-shell nanostructure, including dissolving RhCl, and thiourea in distilled water separately to form a RhCl, solution and a thiourea solution; adding the RhC1, solution to the thiourea solution slowly under stirring until obtaining a transparent mixture solution; performing a hydrothermal reaction on the mixture solution; cooling the solution to room temperature and gathering brown precipitates from the solution and washing with ethanol and deionized water; drying the brown precipitates under vacuum overnight; and. transforming the brown precipitates into the yolk-shell nano- structure in air atmosphere by heat treating.\n\n[0014] Ina first embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention, a mass ratio between RhCl and thiourea is in a range of 15:1 to 2:1.\n\n[0015] Ina second embodiment of the second aspect of the resent invention, a working temperature during the hydro- thermal reaction is in a range of 120\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C.\n\n[0016] Ina third embodiment of the second aspect of the resent invention, a working time during the hydrothermal reaction is in a range of 1 to 48 hours.", "type": "Document"}}
