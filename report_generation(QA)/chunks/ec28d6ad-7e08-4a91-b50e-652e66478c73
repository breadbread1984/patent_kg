Then, the mixture is heated at 80\u00b0 C. under a nitrogen atmosphere for 5 h and monitored by thin layer chromatography. After cooling to room tem- perature, the solution is removed under reduced pressure. The resulted product purified via silica gel column chroma- tography affords 62 mg (34.6%) ofCeo-BPy. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3) 88.65 (d, J=5.1 Hz, 2H), 7.74 (s, 2H), 5.12 (d, J=9.5 Hz, 1H), 5.04 (s, 1H), 4.13 (d, J=9.4 Hz, 1H), 3.17 (dt, J=11.9, 8.3 Hz, 1H), 2.59 (ddd, J=12.1, 8.3, 4.2 Hz, 1H), 1.91-1.46 (m, 4H), 1.08 (t, J=7.3 Hz, 3H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCI3/CS2) 6155.94, 153.75, 152.58, 152.15, 150. 22, 147.39, 146.71, 146.41, 146.37, 146.29, 146.25, 146.20, 146.05, 146.03, 145.74, 145.72, 145.65, 145.52, 145.47, 145.43, 145.39, 145.38, 145.33, 145.30, 145.27, 144.79, 144.65, 144.49, 144.40, 143.25, 143.12, 142.81, 142.72, 142.69, 142.66, 142.33, 142.28, 142.22, 142.15, 142.11, 142.05, 141.93, 141.88, 141.78, 141.65, 140.37, 140.08, 139.61, 137.13, 136.43, 136.10, 135.64, 124.32, 81.55, 75.92, 68.98, 66.92, 53.25, 30.85, 21.13, 14.57.
