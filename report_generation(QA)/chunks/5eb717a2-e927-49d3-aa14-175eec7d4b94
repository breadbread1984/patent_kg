FIG. 4A shows the representative confocal images of recipi- ent cell suspension after mitochondrial transfer at 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 units, separately. One unit of mitochondria stands for concentration of mitochondria isolated from 1x10\u00b0 cells and suspended in 10 HL mitochondria storing reagent. The transferred mitochondria were labelled with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM before isolation, and the recipient cells were labelled with Cell Mask Deep Red before encapsulation into droplets. Three recipient cells from each unit were selected to illustrate the localization of the transferred mitochondria inside the cells (bottom). FIG. 4B shows the average number of transferred mitochondria per cells under different mito- chondria concentrations. Mitochondria numbers were counted within the 3D rebuilding images under the confocal fluorescence microscope. FIG. 4C shows the transfer efli- ciency calculated as the ratio of the number of isolated mitochondria transferred into a recipient cell to the total number of isolated mitochondria encapsulated in a droplet. All data in FIG. 4B and FIG. 4C were presented as mean+SD.", "type": "Document"}}
