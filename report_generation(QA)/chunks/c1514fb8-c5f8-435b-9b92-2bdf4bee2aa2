In muscle tis- sues, when heteroplasmy exceeds a certain level or the mitochondria becomes dysfunctional, less ATP and exces- sive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, which can trigger muscle atrophy, weakness, and loss of endurance. Previous clinical and preclinical animal studies demonstrated links between increased mitochondrial dam- age and poor skeletal muscle health. Since 1990s, cell therapy, especially myoblast transplantation, has been pro- posed to improve the regeneration of injured skeletal muscles. However, failure of early clinical trials with myo- blast transplantation has been observed due to host immune cells such as CD8+ T lymphocytes causing massive cell death. The accumulation of immune cells produces sarco- Jemma damage, induces activation of caspase 3 in myofi- bers, and further induces apoptosis in muscle fibers. There- fore, new approaches, such as macrophages regulation and chemical induction of stem cells, need to be developed to treat skeletal muscle disorders. Restoring or improving mitochondrial functions to facilitate muscle regeneration is an attractive approach.", "type": "Document"}}
