Then, the confocal fluorescence microscope (LEICA SP8LIA++ TRUE Confocal Laser Scanning Micro- scope) was used to take a slice of droplets containing single cells (labelled with Cell Mask Deep Red) and isolated mitochondria (labelled with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM). Afterwards, 3D reconstruction of the taken slices was con- ducted using the confocal microscopy software. Finally, the isolated mitochondria transferred into the cell were counted as the green particles inside the red cell region, and the green particles outside the red cell region were counted as the un-transferred isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial transfer efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the transferred mitochondria to the total mitochondria inside the droplet. The same process was repeated for cells recovered from droplets to count the number of mitochondria transferred under different concentration of isolated mitochondria con- centration used.\n\nDroplet Rupture and Cell Collection\n\n[0042] The collected droplets floated on the top the fluo- rinated oil. Before the droplets broke, the extra oil on the bottom of the tube was removed. Then, 1 ml of 50% 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctanol (PFO, Thermo Scientific\u2122, AAB2015609) was added to the tube containing the col- lected droplets and gently vortexed for 1 minute for the droplets to merge into a bulk solution. Afterwards, the upper bulk solution was carefully moved to a new tube and centrifuged at 300 g for 3 minutes to collect the cells.\n\nMyogenic Differentiation of C2C12", "type": "Document"}}
