The method for preparing these two types of devices are known to the skilled persons. For example, references can be made to Zhen Li, et al., Organometallic-functionalized interfaces for highly efficient inverted perovskite solar cells, Science, Vol. 376, Issue 6591, pp. 416-420, 2022). The equation of Vyp,=eN 17/28 can be used to compute the trap density (N,), where L is the perovskite film thickness, \u00a2 is the relative dielectric constant, sois the vacuum permittivity, and V rrr is the trap-filling voltage. After Ceo-BPy modification, the hole trap density decreases from about 5.93x10'> cm7* to about 4.16x10!\u00b0 cm7%, and the electron trap density reduces from about 1.14x1015 cmr? to about 5.91x10'\u00b0 cm-3. The reduced hole and electron trap densities demon- strate that the defects at the perovskite/ETL interface of the devices have been suppressed via the modification of Ceo- BPy.\n\n[0166] The Urbach energy, which is the energetic disorder at the band edge, is further calculated using the formula a=d,exp(E/Eu), where a is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, and Eu is the Urbach energy. As illus-\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\ntrated in FIG. 12, the FAoaeEDAooaSnIs perovskite film modified with Cso-BPy exhibits a sharper band edge than the pristine one.\n\n[0167] Moreover, the Eu is about 54 meV for the control sample, while reduces to about 38 meV for the Cuo-BPy modified film, which originates from the lower band edge energy disorder and trap density.", "type": "Document"}}
