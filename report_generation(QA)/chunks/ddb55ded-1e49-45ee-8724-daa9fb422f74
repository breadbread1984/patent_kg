The media were then replaced with DMEM (Gibco\u2122, 11965084) supplemented with 2% horse serum (Gibco\u2122, 16050130). The cells were kept in differentiation medium until the end of the assay, typically between day 5 to day 7. Myotube formation was monitored every two days. The time-points were days 0, 3, and 7.\n\nMIT Assay\n\n[0044] The cell proliferation rate of each C2C12 cell group was determined by MTT assay. In brief, C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cell/cm? in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were treated with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 100 wL, 0.5 mg/mL) for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The produced dark blue formazan crystals were solubilized by 100 nL DMSO. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader.\n\n[0045] In use, the developed droplet-based mitochondria transfer system of FIG. 1A employs. Three kinds of solu- tions such as (1) mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell sus- pension, (2) isolated mitochondria suspension, and (3) sur- factant-added fluorinated oil. Then, mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell suspension, isolated mitochondria suspension, and surfactant-added fluorinated oil (Sphere Fluidics, C021)\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\nare loaded into the droplet generation module 10 via three inlets. After that, the generated droplets are collected in the droplet collection module 30.
