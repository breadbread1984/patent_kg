The transfer efficiency of co-culture method is influenced by the quantity of extracellular isolated mitochondria. Though it could reach the highest at 28% in a previous study, the number of transferred mitochondria is considerably heterogeneous (1-60 mitochondria per recipient cells) even when subjected to an equal amount of isolated mitochondria. Despite being a rather simple process, the success of the co-culture method is dependent on many uncontrollable factors that underlie the unsatisfactory cell metabolism recovery rate of recipient cells in previous work (~0.2%). An automated optical twee- zers-based manipulation system (OT-based manipulation system) was used for qualitative and quantitative mitochon- drial transfer to reduce influences from uncontrollable fac- tors. The OT-based system could precisely pick up the healthy mitochondria and transport them to the target recipi- ent cell. However, this method suffers from the limitation of low throughput, which makes it difficult to be used for clinical applications.\n\n[0004] Unlike co-culture methods, microinjection injects the isolated mitochondria preloaded in a microneedle directly into the recipient cells; thus, it may cause damage to the recipient cells owing to the cell membrane opening during the delivery process. In addition, the throughput of the microinjection technique is low.\n\n[0005] All the methods mentioned above provide useful tools for studying the mechanism of cell functions\u2019 resto- ration or improvement upon mitochondrial transfer. How- ever, they still could not fulfill the demand of a large quantity of mitochondria-transferred recipient cells in the cell therapy industry. The co-culture technique shows considerable advantage due to being harmless, but its low efliciency and heterogeneity are still a major bottleneck.", "type": "Document"}}
