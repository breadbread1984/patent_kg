The J-V characteristics of photovoltaic devices is con- ducted in a N,-filled glovebox at room temperature by using a Xenon lamp solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5, Taiwan). The power of the light is calibrated to 100 mW cm-2 by a silicon reference cell (with a KG2 filter). All the devices are measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a sweep mode of reverse scan (from 1.20 V to -0.01 V) and forward scan (from -0.01 V to 1.20 V) with the scan rate of 0.01 V s-1, and the delay time is 10 ms. The results indicate that each solar cell parameter improves when compared to the control device, and that the average PCE exhibits a tendency of growing initially and then dropping as the concentration of Ceo-BPy increases.\n\n[0173] In FIG. 24, the control PVSC exhibits a maximum PCE of about 12.29%, with an open-circuit voltage (Yoc) of about 0.753 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of about 22.73 mA cm\u201d? and a fill factor (FF) of about 71.8%. As compared to the control device, the C,.-BPy interlayer (about 1.0 mg mL-0 functionalized device shows an enhanced PCE of about 14.14%, with a Yoc of about 0.820 V, a Isc of about 23.45 mA/cm? and an FF of about 73.1%.\n\n[0174] The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the champion device (a concentration of Ceo-BPy of about 1.0 mg mL\") in FIG. 25 produces integrated J... with a minor difference from the value obtained from the J-V measurements. The Ceo-BPy functionalized device is also measured at the maximum power point (MPP) to obtain a stabilized photocurrent of about 20.45 mA cm\u2122 and a stabilized PCE of about 13.50%.
