In some embodiments, about 10 mol % to about 15 mol % of excess SnF, and about 20 mg to about 30 mg Sn powder is added into the solution to suppress the Sn oxida- tion. The solution is stirred at room temperature for about 6 h to about 10 h and is filtered through a 0.45 jum filter before use.\n\n3. Perovskite Solar Cell (PVSC)\n\n[0072] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a perovskite solar cell, in particular an inverted perovskite solar cell, including a surface treatment layer containing a a functionalized fullerene derivative having a structure of Formula I described herein.\n\n[0073] Among perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), it is believed that inverted (p-n/p-i-n structure) devices have typically exhibited more stable behaviour than conventional (n-p/n-i-p) PVSCs, due in part to their non-doped hole transporting materials and highly crystalline perovskite films. The following description is with primary reference to inverted PVSCs, but the beneficial effects of an interface\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nlayer (i.e., a surface treatment layer described herein after) as described herein apply equally to a conventional PVSC structure.\n\nSubstrate\n\n[0074] In some embodiments, the perovskite solar cell includes a substrate, which forms the base or support for the solar cell structure. Visible light (such as incident sunlight) enters the solar cell through the substrate.", "type": "Document"}}
