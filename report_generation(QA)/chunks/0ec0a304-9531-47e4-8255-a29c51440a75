In some embodiments, about 30 WL to about 100 HL (preferably about 60 HL) perovskite precursor solution is spin coated under this condition. In some embodiments, the perovskite precursor solution has a concentration of from about 0.85 M to about 1.0 M (preferably 0.9725 M). In some embodi- ments, before the end of coating the the perovskite precursor solution, about 150 hL to about 300 hL (preferably about 200 tL) anti-solvent chlorobenzene is slowly dripped onto the center of perovskite film during about 5 s to about 18 s (preferably about 9 s). The as-prepared perovskite films are subsequently annealed on a hotplate at from about 90\u00b0 C. to about 160\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 7 min to about 50 min (preferably about 30 min). It is believed that the perovskite layer prepared under such conditions will form more complete perovskite crystals, and the layer may have a uniform and dense surface.\n\n[0133] In some embodiments, the step of preparing the surface treatment layer comprises:\n\n[0134] preparing the solution comprising the function- alized fullerene derivative at a concentration from about 0.5 mg mL~' to about 2.0 mg mL~' (preferably about 1.0 mg/mL);\n\n[0135] spin-coating the solution comprising the func- tionalized fullerene derivative onto the perovskite layer at from about 2500 rpm to 5500 rpm (preferably about 4000 rpm) for about 18 s to 30 s (preferably 30 s); and\n\n[0136] annealing at from about 85\u00b0 C. to about 135\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 1 min to about 10 min.", "type": "Document"}}
