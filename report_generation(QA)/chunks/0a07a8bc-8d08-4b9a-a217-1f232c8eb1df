The measurement is performed at room temperature in N, atmosphere.\n\n[0150] Under simulated AM 1.5 G in N, glovebox at room temperature, the J-V curves of perovskite devices are recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter, and the EQE spectra are carried out by a QE-R EQE system (EnLi Technology, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, https://enlitechnology. com/home/products/eqe-photon-electron-conversion-test- ing/qe-r/). The active area is defined as 0.105 cm? and the light intensity is calibrated using a standard KG2 Si diode. All the devices are measured under a sweep mode of reverse scan (from 1.20 V to -0.01 V) and forward scan (from -0.01 V to 1.20 V) with the scan rate of 0.01 V s-1, and the delay time is 10 ms.\n\nExample 1\n\nPreparation of Functionalized Fullerene Derivatives", "type": "Document"}}
