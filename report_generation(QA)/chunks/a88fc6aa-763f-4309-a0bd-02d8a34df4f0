The SEM image of Rh,;/NSC YSS was shown in FIG. 3A. The results showed that the average size of the prepared Rh, ./NSC YSS was 145.1+4.4 nm (FIG. 3B), and the shell thickness of the prepared Rh,./NSC YSS was 7.7+0.1 nm (FIG. 3C).\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\n[0075] In addition, the interior structure of as obtained Rh,;/NSC YSS was further elucidated by transmission elec- tron microscopy (TEM) (FIG. 3D). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image showed a representative interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm, suggesting the association with (111) plane of the cubic Rh phase. In ddition to (111) plane, several atomic layers of RhO, (with he lattice spacing of 0.17 nm corresponding to (211) plane \u4eba RhO,, JCPDS NO. 43-1026) was also observed on the surface of Rh,;/NSC YSS (FIG. 3E). ome\n\n0076] Moreover, the high-angle annular dark field HAADF) STEM image clearly proved the porosity and heterogeneity of the nanostructure. It was obvious in FIG. 3F that the core of the nanostructure has a higher Rh content compared to the shell. Elemental mappings of the Rh, ,/NSC YSS indicates that C, Rh, S and N elements are unevenly distributed on the surface. mars\n\nExample 3\u2014Effect of Changing the Mass Ratio of RhCl and Thiourea", "type": "Document"}}
