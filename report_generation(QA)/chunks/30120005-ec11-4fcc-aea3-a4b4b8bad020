The imperfect interfacial structural and electronic mismatches usually act as energy barriers for charge transport and charge recombi- nation. Furthermore, it is believed that defects at the surface and interface of polycrystalline perovskite films are mostly either positively charged or negatively charged. Trap states\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nat the perovskite surface and interfaces can lead to charge accumulation and recombination losses in the device.\n\n[0107] In some embodiment, the surface treatment layer is inserted between the perovskite layer and the electron trans- port layer. It has been surprisingly found that the perfor- mance of the perovskite solar cell described herein can be improved when the surface treatment layer comprising an interfacial compound (i.e., the functionalized fullerene derivative) as described herein is provided between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer. It is believed that such surface treatment layer can suppress defects in the perovskite surface and minimize interfacial non-radiative combination losses. In this way, the surface treatment layer improves the extraction of electrons at the perovskite interface, increases the efficiency of the solar cell, and improves the stability of the solar cell.\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, the surface treatment layer interfaces directly with the perovskite layer. In other words, the surface treatment layer and the perovskite layer are in direct contact. The surface treatment layer can be deposited directly on the active perovskite layer, as described below, or may be otherwise formed.", "type": "Document"}}
