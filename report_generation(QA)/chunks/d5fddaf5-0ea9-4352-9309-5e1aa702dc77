All the reported potentials were calibrated versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation of Egur=Escet(0.2415+0.059xpH) V. where Ep;;- is the potential referred to RHE and E,.., is the measured potential against the SCE reference electrode. The electrochemical activity of the samples towards HER and OER were sur- veyed in IM KOH aqueous solution (pH=14) by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s 1. To keep the electrode surface in a relatively stable state, several cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles were operated before the assessment of electrochemical activity until the hydrogen evolution currents showed the unnoticeable change. Unless otherwise mentioned, the voltammograms were recorded with the iR drop compensation automatically on the work- station. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 1.5 V (vs. RHE) over a frequency range of between 0.05 Hz and 100 kHz at 5 mV s\n\nCalculation of TOF:\n\n[0097] Turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated from the equation of\n\nIxA TOR = 2xFxn\u2019\n\nwhere I is the current density, A is the exposed surface area of the electrocatalyst, F is the Faradic constant and n is the moles of the active materials. Herein, the noble metal atoms for each catalyst loaded on the glass carbon electrode are considered as active sites.\n\nPreparation of Electrolytes:\n\n[0098] The electrolyte was prepared as follows; as seen from the electrolytes below, all pH values from alkaline to acidic are covered in the present invention:\n\n0.5 M H)S0, (pH = 0.36),", "type": "Document"}}
