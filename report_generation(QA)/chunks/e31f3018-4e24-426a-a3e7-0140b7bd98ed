Mutations of mtDNA impair the functions of cells and tissues. It is observed that spontaneous transfer of mitochondria can occur in nature between healthy and damaged cells via different mechanisms, which is believed to protect the damaged cells and restore their cellular function. Mitochondrial transfer is a technique to alter mtDNA in cells, and has attracted more and more attention since it was first reported by Clark and Shay. Mitochondrial transfer has already been used in cell therapy for mtDNA-related diseases. It is easier to perform and practically more efficient than other techniques modifying the mitochondrial genome, such as mitoZFNs and mitoTAL- ENs. Transferring exogenous mitochondria into recipient cells could also reduce the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA, and promote the restoration or improvement of cell and tissue functions. Previous studies showed that exog- enous isolated mitochondria could be delivered into cells via co-culture or microinjection. In the method of co-culture with isolated mitochondria, the isolated mitochondria are engulfed by the recipient cells via endocytosis, which is a kind of cellular activity to uptake objects ranging from nanometers to several micrometers from the surrounding environment. The isolated mitochondria randomly move around the recipient cell and have chances to be engulfed by the cell when contacting it; this phenomenon could be\n\nDec. 21, 2023", "type": "Document"}}
