The small gas bubbles inside can diffuse into the large bubbles easily through the shell because of the pressure difference, then bubbles on the outside will be quickly released. The ion transfer rate is positively correlated to the rate of gas escape; hence, the rapid desorption of gas bubbles for Rh,,/NSC YSS is beneficial for accelerating the catalytic reaction (FIG. 11D, middle).\n\n[0095] For the Rhao/NSC YSS, the generated gas bubbles are easily trapped in the porous channel. covering the active sites and reducing the catalytic performance (FIG. 11D, bottom).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nElectrochemical Measurements:\n\n[0096] For electrochemical measurement, the well-dis- persed catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonication with 3 mg of fabricated electrocatalyst, 50 HL of distilled water, 170 uL of ethanol, 10 pL of Nafion for 2 hours. Then, 5 hL of the catalyst ink was pipetted onto the glass carbon electrode surface (5 mm in diameter, S=0.19625 cm\u201d). All electro- chemical characterization was investigated with a Gamry 300 electrochemical workstation connected with a standard three-electrode configuration under 25\u00b0 C. using a constant temperature bath. The fabricated electrode sample was used as the working electrode. A saturated calomel electrode\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al", "type": "Document"}}
