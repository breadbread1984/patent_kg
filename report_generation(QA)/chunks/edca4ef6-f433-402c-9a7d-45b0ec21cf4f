These droplets are the basic unit for further chemical reactions, cell life activities, target detections, and material synthesis. Droplet microfluidics provides a much smaller and constrained environment than the bulk volume method, thus allowing more rapid reaction and detection of molecules/particles and interactions with encapsulated cells. Previous works have demonstrated that the droplet genera- tion rates could be as high as thousands of droplets per second, making droplet microfluidics a high-throughput technique intrinsically. An important application of droplet microfluidics is single-cell analysis, in which a single cell is encapsulated in one droplet for analyzing cell life activities or cell modification, such as antibody analysis or gene editing.\n\n[0007] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2017/ 159017A1 entitled: \u201cMethod for introducing exogenous mitochondria into a mammalian cell\u201d and US patent U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/149778A1 entitled: \u201cMethod and Applications of Peptide-Mediated Mitochon- drial Delivery System\u201d applies natural cell membrane engulfing processes also known as endocytosis to transfer isolated mitochondria.\n\n[0008] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2019/ 276852A1 entitled: \u201cMethod for delivering exogenous mito- chondria into cells\u201d and Europe Patent Application Publi- cation No. EP3169338A1 entitled: \u201cMethods for the intercellular transfer of isolated mitochondria in recipient cells\u201d apply the centrifugation method to transfer mitochon-\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\ndria.
