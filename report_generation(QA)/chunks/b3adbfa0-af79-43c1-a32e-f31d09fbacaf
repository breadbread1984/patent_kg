In an embodiment herein, the electron transport layer preferably includes PC,,BM. Without being bound to theory, it is believed that PC,,BM can passivate the defects in the perovskite functional layer and at the interface, and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the solar cell device. The PCBM interface modification layer is intro- duced to modify the interface at the electron transport layer/perovskite layer to improve the optoelectronic perfor- mance of the solar cell device. It is believed that the PCBM interface modification cannot completely eliminate the hys- teresis effect of the solar cell, so this invention dopes the PCBM material into the photovoltaic functional layer of the solar cell device to study the effect of the grain boundary gap on the solar cell performance.\n\nMetal Electrode\n\n[0086] In some embodiments, the solar cell may further includes a metal electrode. In some embodiments, the metal electrode is selected from the group of Ag, Au, Al, Cu and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, the metal electrode is preferably Ag or Au. In some embodiments, carbon can also be used as the electrode of the solar cell.\n\nTin-Based PVSC Structures\n\n[0087] In some embodiments, the above-described perov- skite solar cell may be a tin-based perovskite solar cell (PVSC).\n\n[0088] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC includes a perovskite layer containing a tin-based perovskite composition having the empirical formula CS,EDA,FA aySnl, as defined herein.
