The solution is then transferred to a N,-filled glovebox before use. About 50~120 pL C,,-BPy solution is spin- coated on top of the perovskite layer at from about 4000~6000 rpm for about 10~25 s, and next transferred to the hotplate and annealed at from about 60~80\u00b0 C. for about 2~5 min. The spin-coating processes are all conducted at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) in a N,-filled glovebox with the contents of O, and H,O<2 ppm.\n\n[0140] In some embodiments, after the surface treatment layer is coated, about 10~30 nm C,, with an evaporating rate of from about 0.3~1.5 As -1 , about 4~10 nm BCP at a rate of from about 0.2~1.2 As-1 and about 70~120 nm silver electrode at a rate of from about 0.5~3.0 As\u2122' are thermally evaporated, respectively, under high vacuum (<4x107\u00b0 Torr).\n\n[0141] In certain embodiments, the above-mentioned defi- nitions and descriptions regarding the substrate, the hole transport layer, the electron transport layer, and the electrode also apply to the process herein.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nMaterials and Methods", "type": "Document"}}
