Lax\n\n[0089] Without intending to be limited by theory it is belived that the present inveniton develops a synergistic strategy combining component optimization, crystallization regulation and interface functionalization to fabricate the high-efficiency and stable lead-free tin PVSCs. The compo- nent and crystallization manipulation can decrease the bulk defect density and suppresses the tin oxidation. In addition, it is believed that the fullerene derivatives such fullerene-\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nn-butyl-pyridine (Ceo-BPy) according to the invention, as an interface functionalization material, simultaneously enhance the efficiency and stability of tin PVSCs.\n\n[0090] In some embodiments, the surface treatment layer is in contact with one side of the perovskite layer.\n\n[0091] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention has a PCE of about 12.5% to about 14.5%. For example, the resulting devices according to the invention can achieve a PCE of about 14.14% with negli- gible hysteresis. In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC according to the invention maintains over about 95% of their initial PCE under continuous one-sun illumination for about 1000 hours.\n\n[0092] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention further includes the following layers:\n\n[0093] a substrate;\n\n[0094] optionally a first charge-extraction between the substrate and the perovskite layer; layer\n\n[0095] optionally a second charge-extraction layer on the surface treatment layer; and\n\n[0096] a metal electrode on the second charge-extrac- tion layer,\n\n[0097] wherein each of the first charge-extraction layer and the second charge-extraction layer\n\n[0098] could be either a hole transport layer or an electron transport layer.", "type": "Document"}}
