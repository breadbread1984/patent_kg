A droplet generation module 10 is configured to generate droplets 40 containing isolated mitochondria and a single cell. The droplet generation module 10 also comprises a wave-like structure which is configured to focus randomly distributed cells from the inlet to a line to improve the single cell encapsulation ratio and suppress the multiple cell encap- sulation ratio. Element 20 is a droplet observation module configured for observation of the generated droplets under a microscope (not shown). Element 30 is a droplet collection module configured to collect the generated droplets 40. The droplet generation and observation modules may be con- nected by a conduit 50. Optionally, the system 1 is disposed. on a chip 60 as seen in FIG. 1F.\n\nMicrofluidic Chip Fabrication and Operations\n\n[0038] The designed chip was fabricated using soft-lithog- raphy. Prior to experiments, the chip channels were coated with a surface modification agent to make them hydrophobic for stable water-in-oil droplet generation and transporting.\n\nCell Culture\n\n[0039] C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco modi- fied Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Gibco\u2122, 11965084) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco\u2122, 12800058) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco\u2122, 15240096) at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO,\n\nMitochondria Isolation", "type": "Document"}}
