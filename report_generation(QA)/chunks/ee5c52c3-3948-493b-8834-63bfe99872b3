Then, the substrate is dried at about 80\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C. in an oven, and then is treated with oxygen plasma for about 5 min to about 20 min and finally transferred into a N,-filled glovebox before use. The substrate may be an ITO substrate having a surface resistivity of from about 10 Qsq7' to about 45 Qsq7', preferably about 15 Qsq7'. Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the surface resistivity of the substrate is negatively correlated with the transmit- tance of the substrate. If the resistance is too large, then the charge transfer will be affected. If the resistance is too small, the light transmittance of the substrate is poor, reducing the device efficiency.\n\n[0118] In some embodiment, HTL materials (for example PEDOT:PSS) is filtered through a 0.45 hm filter and spin- coated on the substrate at from about 3500 rpm to about 4500 rpm (preferably about 4000 rpm) for about 50 s to 60 s (preferably 60 s), and then annealed at from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 10 min to about 20 min (preferably 15 min). It is believed that, under such conditions, the HTL layer will be produced with uniform and dense surface.\n\n[0119] In some embodiments, the process of preparing the tin-based inverted PVSC according to the invention further includes the step of:\n\n[0120] preparing a surface treatment layer by coating a solution containing a functionalized fullerene deriva- tive onto the perovskite layer, in which the function- alized fullerene derivative has a structure of formula I below:\n\nFormula I\n\nFormula R N", "type": "Document"}}
