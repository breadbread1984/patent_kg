R, is the overall series resistance. CPE, and R, are the constant phase element and resistance describing electron transport at sub- strate/catalyst interface, respectively. CPE,, is the constant phase element of the catalyst/electrolyte interface, and R,,,, is the mass-transfer resistance at catalyst/electrolyte inter- face. The semicircles in the high-frequency range and low- frequency range are associated with charge-transfer resis- tance (R,,) and mass-transfer resistance (R,,,,), respectively. The elements of the value in the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table 2. Among these three samples, it can be seen that Rh,./NSC YSS exhibits the lowest R., (8.372) and R,,,, (1.74), indicating a faster HER process.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nValues of the elements in the equivalent circuit Catalysts Rhy/NSC NP Rhys/NSC \u4e86\u3002 Q R @) ems) 2 \u00a9 Qa Gems\") ay \u4eba 3.96 1.38 x 105 0.69 6.39 6.1 x 10-3 1.23 2.41 3.87 556x104 0.76 4.50 15 x 10? 1.00 1.74\n\nYSS\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\nTABLE 2-continued\n\nValues of the elements in the equivalent circuit R, Q Ri Qu Catalysts (@) (Fen2.sS nm (OO :en2.S\u201c 0 35x104 078 868 71x103 RhawNSC 4.20 PP 0.92\n\nNote:\n\nthe charge-transfer resistance (R,,) = the sum of R, and R, in the equivalent circuit.\n\nExample 5\u2014Effect on Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA)", "type": "Document"}}
