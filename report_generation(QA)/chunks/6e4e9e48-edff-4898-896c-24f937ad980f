In some embodiments, the removing of the solution is performed after cooling to room temperature and under reduced pres- sure. In some embodiments, the process further comprise the step of purifying the resulted product via silica gel column chromatography.\n\n(13) 2. Perovskite Composition\n\n[0065] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a tin-based perovskite composition having the empirical formula: Cs,EDA,FA,_,.2,Snl, in which x is from about 0 to about 0.12; y is from about 0.01 to about 0.03; FA is formamidinium; and EDA is ethylenediamine. For example, in the empirical formula, x may be about 0, and y may be about 0.02.\n\n[0066] In some embodiments, the tin-based perovskite composition has any of the following empirical formulae: FA 6EDAo oaSnl\u3002 ; C89 12EDAo.o3F Ap g2Snlz; EDA. oIFAu oosSnla: and CsooeEDAooisFAosiSnls.\n\n[0067] Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the tin-based perovskite composition of this invention contains EDA?* ions, which can better stabilize the tin-based perovskite crystal structure and improve the stability of tin-based perovskite devices, compared with traditional tin-based perovskite (Cs,FA,_.PbI,).\n\n[0068] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing a perovskite precursor solution, which includes the following steps:\n\n[0069] mixing SnI,, FAI, CsI and EDADI in DMF: DMSO mixed solvent in certain amount to meet the empirical formula of Cs,EDA,FA,_,.2,Snl; (where x is about 0~0.12, and y is about 0.010.03); and.\n\n[0070] _ stirring the perovskite precursor solution.", "type": "Document"}}
