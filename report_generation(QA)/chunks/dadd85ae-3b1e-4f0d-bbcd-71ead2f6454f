The Ceo-BPy treated devices show excellent light stability with about 95.3% initial PCE retained after 1000 hours. In contrast, the PCE of the control devices degraded to about 75.2%. In addition, for the heating sta- bility shown in FIG. 28, the Cgo-BPy treated PVSC maintained>about 80% initial PCE after 1000 hours aging, while the PCE of the control device decayed to about 60%.\n\n[0176] To demonstrate the unique effect of Ceo-BPy inter- face modification on tin PVSCs, the inventors compare the efliciencies of tin and lead PVSCs treated with and without Co-BPy. As can be seen from the comparison of normalized efficiencies in FIG. 29, the introduction of Ceo-BPy can significantly improve the efficiency of tin PVSCs; on the contrary, the introduction of Cso-BPy into lead PVSCs only slightly improves the efficiency.\n\n[0177] It should be understood that the above only illus- trates and describes examples whereby the present invention may be carried out, and that modifications and/or alterations may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.\n\n[0178] It should also be understood that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combi- nation in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately, or in any suitable subcombination.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al", "type": "Document"}}
