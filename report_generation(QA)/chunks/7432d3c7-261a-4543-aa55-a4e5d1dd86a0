In some embodiment, the tin-based PVSC does not include the hole transport layer or the electron transport layer. In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC according to the inven- tion has any of the following structures: electrode/HTM/ perovskite/ETL/substrate, electrode/ETL/perovskite/HTM/ substrate, electrode/HTM/perovskite/substrate, electrode/ perovskite/ETL/substrate, in which the perovskite is covered by the surface treatment layer.\n\n[0100] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention further includes the following layers:\n\n[0101] a substrate;\n\n[0102] a hole transport layer between the substrate and the perovskite layer;\n\n[0103] an electron transport layer on the surface treat- ment layer; and\n\n[0104] a metal electrode on the electron transport layer. [0105] In the PVSCs, the functional or active perovskite layer are sandwiched between the HTL and ETL. In other words, the charge transporting layers are deposited on the top and the bottom sides of the perovskite active layer, respectively. The charge carriers are extracted at the HTL/ perovskite and perovskite/ETL interfaces and collected through the respective conductors/contacts. During this pro- cess, the carrier charges may be subject to recombination, for example due to any interfacial defects and associated. specific charge distributions.", "type": "Document"}}
