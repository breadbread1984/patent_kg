The ETL comprises an electron transport material. Any electron transport material known to the skilled person may be used. The ETL may comprise or consist of an organic electron transport material, an inor- ganic electron transport material or mixtures thereof. Example electron transport materials include organic mate- rials such as fullerenes, for example Ceo or Phenyl-C,,- butyric acid methyl ester (PCeiBM), metal oxides such as TiO,, ZnO, SnO,. Electron transport materials may encour- age a flow of electrons from the n-type perovskite, away from the junction within the perovskite layer 30, while blocking the movement of holes. In this way, electrons accumulate at electron transport layer 50. In use, the electron transport layer 50 is negatively charged due to the accumu- ation of electrons. When the solar cell is connected to an external load, the electrons leave the solar cell via the electron transport layer 50.", "type": "Document"}}
