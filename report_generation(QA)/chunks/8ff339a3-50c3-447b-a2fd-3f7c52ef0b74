If only thio- urea participates in the hydrothermal reaction during this process, no product will be obtained.\n\n[0082] (ii) When the Rh/C mass ratio increases, Rh>* ions tend to perform homogeneous nucleation because of the positive redox potential of Rh**. Therefore, in the initial stage, the homogeneous nucleation of Rh** ions dominate the reaction. When Rh?* ions are con- tinuously consumed and drop to a critical value, the remaining Rh** ions and thiourea repeat the stage I and proceed copolymerization reaction on the surface of the core via Rh\u2014S bonds to form the Rh/NSC shell. Finally, under heat treatment, compared with the shell with low Rh/NSC mass ratio, the evaporation rate and volatile products of the core are more pronounced, leading to the generation of voids and the formation of Rh/NSC yolk-shell structure.\n\n[0083] (iii) If the Rh/C mass ratio keeps increasing, the homogeneous nucleation of Rh?+ ions dominates the reaction in the whole process. Thiourea would then participate in the reaction through copolymerization with Rh** ions and acts as a structural indicator. Thus, after high-temperature carbonization treatment, a porous nanostructure is formed.\n\nExample 5\u2014HER Electrocatalytic Performance of Rh,;/NSC YSS", "type": "Document"}}
