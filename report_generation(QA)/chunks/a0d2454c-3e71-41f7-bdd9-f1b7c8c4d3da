The Ceo-BPy treated perov- skite film shows an obvious decreased intensity compared to the control sample. Moreover, the carrier lifetime of Ceo- BPy treated films obtained by fitting the TRPL spectra exhibits a reduction from about 8.67 ns to about 1.73 ns. The findings suggest that the Ceo-BPy functionalization can boost electron extraction at the perovskite/ETL interface.\n\n[0171] Accordingly, the energy level diagrams of the control and the C,o-BPy functionalized perovskite are dis- played in FIG. 22. Compared to the control one, a more \u201cn-type\u201d nature for C,o-BPy functionalized interface is verified because of the upshifted Fermi level relative to the vacuum band. This optimal energy level alignment can not only allow photogenerated electron to be extracted by the ETL with reduced energy loss, but also bounce back elec- trons at the interface.\n\n3. Performances of Cg -BPy modified photovoltaic devices\n\n[0172] The PVSCs are prepared with the method described above, with the only difference that different concentrations of Ceo-BPy (about 0 mg/mL, about 0.5 mg/mL, about 1.0 mg/mL, about 2.0 mg/mL) are used for producing the C,,-BPy interlayer. To verify the effect of Ceo-BPy interlayer on photovoltaic performance, the J-V\n\nJun. 6, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
