FIG. 2A shows a co-flowing of cell suspension and isolated mitochondrial suspension to the wave-like structure. FIG. 2B shows a wave-like structure for cells focusing on the increase in single-cell encapsulation efficiency. FIG. 2C shows a flow- focusing structure for droplet generation. FIG. 2D shows an isolated mitochondria (stained with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM before isolation) from donor cells (C2C12 myoblasts). FIG. 2E shows an isolated mitochondria taken up by the recipient C2C12 cell, and a portion of droplets collected for further confocal imaging analysis to confirm the success of mitochondrial transfer (recipient cell in red and transferred mitochondria in green). FIG. 2F shows a cell encapsulation efliciency using the wave-like structure under different con- centrations of cell suspension. Here 1 and 2 stand for one and two or more cells encapsulated in one droplet, respec- tively; L stands for 0.8510\u2019 cell/mL; and H stands for\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\n1.7x10\u201d cell/mL. FIG. 2G shows the influence of Oil/Water flow rate ratio on droplet size. FIG. 2H shows the influence of droplet size on mitochondrial transfer efficiency. FIG. 21 shows the influence of cell suspension flow rate on cell viability. All data from FIGS. 2F-2I were presented as mean+SD and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test. *p<0.05 and **p<0.01. The red arrows from A to C indicated the flow directions in the channel of the microfluidic chip.", "type": "Document"}}
