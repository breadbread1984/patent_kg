In some embodiments, the apparatus 500A may be connected across a pair bus-bars (terminal+ and terminal-) on front side and back sides of a generic crystalline PV cell as shown in to FIG. 9.\n\nReferring back to FIG. 8, an apparatus 500B according to the present invention may be connected in parallel with a bypass diode as well as a substring of PV cells. In some embodiments, the apparatus 500B and the bypass diode may be connected in parallel to form a junction box module as shown in FIG. 10, which is to be installed in parallel with the substring of PV cells. The junction box may be placed on the back side of the PV module.\n\nReferring back to FIG. 8, an apparatus 500C according to the present invention may be connected across a PV module including two or more substrings of PV cells.\n\nFIGS. 11A and 11B show electroluminescent images of a PV module controlled with an apparatus according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 11A, when the switch of the apparatus is conducting, the electrical current passes through the PV module, therefore NIR light is emitted by the PV module. As shown in FIG. 11B, when the switch of the apparatus is not conducting, no/less current passes through the PV module, therefore no/minimum NIR light is emitted by the PV module.\n\nFIG. 12 shows how a plurality of PV devices is configured to communicate with a UAV according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 12, a plurality of PV devices 101 is installed in a PV system. Each photovoltaic device is equipped with an apparatus for facilitating the photovoltaic\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n65\n\nWhat is claimed is:\n\n1. An apparatus for facilitating a photovoltaic device to provide a wireless communication channel, comprising:", "type": "Document"}}
