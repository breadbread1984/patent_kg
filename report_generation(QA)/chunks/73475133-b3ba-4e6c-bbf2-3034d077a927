In the present invention, Cs is the same value for all three samples. Thus, ECSA changes can be compared from Cz. As shown in FIG. 9, the Rh,./NSC YSS exhibits the largely increased ECSA, which can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of the Rh active centers.\n\nExample 6\u2014Electrocatalytic Performance of Rh,;/NSC YSS Across all pH Ranges\n\n[0090] An ideal HER electrocatalyst should possess excel- lent performance over a wide pH value, even at all pH values. FIG. 10 records the overpotential (current density is 10 mA cm\u2122\u201d) and corresponding Tafel slopes of the elec- trocatalysts in the whole pH range. In specific, Rh,,/NSC YSS shows a faster kinetic process than that of Pt/C in all the electrolyte of different pH values. Therefore, even in the strong acid condition (pH=0.36 and 1.08) where the over- potential of Rh,;/NSC YSS exceeds that of Pt/C, Rh,;/NSC YSS still exhibits a higher electrocatalytic performance than PC.\n\nExample 7 \u4e00 Hydrophilicity of Different Rh,/NSC YSS", "type": "Document"}}
