It is believed that cooling down to from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 5\u00b0 C. may reduce the rate of solvent evaporation in the solution, and the annealing step above makes perov- skite crystals more complete, with uniform and dense sur- faces.\n\n[0131] In some embodiments, prior to stirring the perov- skite precursor solution, the solution is added with about 10 mol % to about 15 mol % of excess SnF, and about 20 mg to about 30 mg Sn powder to suppress the Sn oxidation. In some embodiments, the perovskite precursor solution is stirred for about 6 h to about 10 h.", "type": "Document"}}
