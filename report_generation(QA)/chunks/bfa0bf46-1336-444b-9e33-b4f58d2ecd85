In one embodiment of the present invention, Rh,/NSC and Rh,,/NSC nanostructures were prepared by changing the mass ratio between RhCls and thiourea (FIG. 4). Rh;/NSC and Rh,,/NSC nanostructures were prepared. by using the same methods in Example 1 except for chang- ing the feeding amount of RhCl, for 5 mg and 30 mg, respectively. The result showed that the crystallographic structure of the Rh,/NSC or Rh,,/NSC nanostructures could be matched well with the standard pattern of cubic Rh phase (JCPDS NO. 87-0714).\n\n[0078] In another embodiment, FIG. 5A showed that Rhs/ NSC YSS exhibited a typical sphere-like nanoparticle (NP) morphology with a size of 290+1.9 nm. The HRTEM image and corresponding EDS mapping revealed that the Rh atoms are evenly distributed on the N, S co-doped carbon surface (FIGS. 5B and 5C). When the Rh content was increased, the HRTEM image and corresponding EDS mapping suggested that the increased Rh content did not change the chemical composition of the product (FIGS. 5E and 5F). However, porous nanoparticles (PP) with a size of 42.5+0.7 nm were obtained (FIG. 5D).\n\n[0079] When the Rh/C ratio was increased, the particle size would decrease exponentially. The relationship between particle size and Rh/C ratio was showed in FIG. 6A. It should be noted here, when the Rh/C ratio is 5 (Rh, )/NSC) and 10 (Rh,,/NSC), the prepared nanostructures still show the yolk-shell structure. Comparing FIGS. 6B and 6C, it can be seen that when the Rh/C ratio is increased from 5 (Rhjo/NSC) to 10 (Rh4o/NSC), the average particle size is decreased by about 38% to 136.4+4.1 nm, and the thickness is decreased by about 62% to 6.9+0.1 nm.\n\nExample 4\u2014Mechanism of Forming Rhx/NSC YSS", "type": "Document"}}
