After 7 days of induction, FIGS. 5A-5C show that the myotube area and length (as indicators of myogenesis) are significantly increased in the high-mito transferred group (31 exogenous isolated mitochondria transferred per cell) compared with the control, low-mito, and mid-mito trans- ferred groups (corresponding to 0, 8 and 14 exogenous isolated mitochondria transferred per cell, respectively). Moreover, MTT assay indicates 2.5 and 1.5 times increase in cell proliferation on day 4 in the high and mid-mito transferred groups, respectively, as shown in FID. 5D.\n\nIndustrial Applicability\n\n[0053] The present invention provides a mitochondrial transfer based on droplet microfluidics system is provided as a high-efficiency quantitative mitochondrial transfer system due to the following advantages:\n\n[0054] The number of mitochondria needed to be trans- ferred into recipient cells is an import issue in precise medicine. The development of the presented invention, which can achieve a precise quantity-control on mitochon- drial transfer at the single cell level, can help us to determine the mitochondria number needed to make a significant function improvement on the recipient cells before conduct- ing the cell therapy for mtDNA-related diseases.\n\n[0055] Compared to existing mitochondrial transfer meth- ods, the invented method can produce massive quantitative mitochondria transferred cells for cell therapy purpose. Although the co-culture with isolated mitochondria method can also produce the number of cells needed for cell therapy, it cannot control the number of mitochondria transferred into\n\nDec. 21, 2023", "type": "Document"}}
