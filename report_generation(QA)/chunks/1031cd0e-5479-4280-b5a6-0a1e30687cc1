FIG. 1A shows a system setup for the droplet microfluidics- based mitochondria transfer technique. FIG. 1B shows a wave-like structure for cell pairing before encapsulation and wave-like structure for mitochondria and cell suspension mixing after encapsulation. FIG. 1C shows a co-encapsula- tion of cells and mitochondria in droplets. FIG. 1D shows a demonstration of cell focusing on the wave-like structure. FIG. 1E shows a demonstration of mitochondrial transfer process via endocytosis in the droplet. FIG. 1F shows fabricated chip for droplet generation and observation. FIG. 1G shows an experimental workflow to demonstrate the effectiveness of mitochondria-transferred recipient cells on myogenic differentiation in-vitro.", "type": "Document"}}
