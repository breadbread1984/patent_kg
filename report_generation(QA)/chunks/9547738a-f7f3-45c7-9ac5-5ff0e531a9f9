In addition to having improved electrocatalytic performance, the Rh,./NSC YSS also exhibits the best hydrophilicity among three kinds of nanostructures, which can be contributed to the existence of capillary force in the small voids. The capillary force would significantly improve the electrolyte infiltration into the voids compared with NP and PP nanostructures, resulting in a smaller contact angle with electrolytes (FIG. HA). Also, the Rh,;/NSC YSS exhibits the excellent aerophobicity, which is beneficial for the Hz desorption (FIG. 11B).\n\nExample 8\u2014Gas Bubbles Release Behavior of Different Rh,/NSC YSS\n\n[0092] To gain a further insight into the effect of nano- structures on the HER performance, the gas bubbles release\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nRane (0)\n\n5.47\n\nbehavior is further investigated during the in-situ electro- chemical process. Taking the HER recorded at -0.05 V (vs RHE) as an example, hydrogen bubbles escaped easily from the Rh,./NSC YSS surface with a size of 28.7\u00a30.1 nm that are obviously smaller than those of Rh,/NSC YSS NP (36.0\u00a32.7 nm) and Rh3,/NSC YSS PP (61.242.1 nm) (FIG. 11C).\n\n[0093] This phenomenon is closely related to the gas bubbles nucleation, transfer and desorption process. Spe- cifically, for the Rh./NSC YSS NP electrocatalyst, typical gas bubbles behavior is occurred on the surface. The bubbles nucleate and grow on the active sites, and after reaching the critical size, they will directly desorb and diffuse into the electrolyte (FIG. 11D, top).\n\n[0094] While for the Rh,;/NSC YSS, compared with the larger bubbles generating on the outer shell, more gas bubbles are quickly generated and restricted on the surface of the core part because of the spatial confinement effect and heterogeneous composition.
