Moreover, due to the smaller size of isolated mitochondria than that of the droplets (1-40 hm in diameter), the isolated mitochondria are evenly encapsulated in each droplet. The number of isolated mitochondria encapsulated in droplets can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of isolated mitochondria suspension. FIGS. 3A-3B show that 8, 22, and 41 isolated mitochondria are encapsulated in each droplet at 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 unit concentrations of isolated mitochon- dria suspension used, respectively. The 1.0 unit of concen- tration refers to mitochondria isolated from 1x10\u00b0 cells and suspended in 10 hL mitochondrial storing reagent (Beyo- time, C3601-3).\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n[0051] In one embodiment, three different concentrations of isolated mitochondrial suspension (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration) are used to verify the transfer effi- ciency of the present invention. FIGS. 4A and 4B show that under 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration used, 8, 14, and 31 isolated mitochondria are transferred into the recipi- ent cells on average, respectively. FIG. 4C shows that under 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration used, the mitochon- drial transfer efficiency is approximately 75%.", "type": "Document"}}
