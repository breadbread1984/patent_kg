Preparation of PVSCs\n\n[0153] The fabrication method of the tin PVSCs is as follows.\n\n[0154] The ITO substrates are sequentially cleaned by sonication with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for about 20 min, respectively. The ITO substrates have a surface resistivity of 15 Qsq7'. Then, the substrates are dried at about 110\u00b0 C. in an oven, and then are treated with oxygen plasma for about 15 min and finally transferred into a N,-filled glovebox before use.\n\n[0155] Next, for the preparation of HTL, PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution is filtered through a 0.45 wm filter and spin-coated on the substrate surface at from about 3500 rpm to about 4000 rpm for about 50 s to 60 s, and then annealed at from about 110\u00b0 C. for about 15 min to about 20 min.\n\n[0156] Then, suitable perovskite materials are coated on the HTL. The optimized tin perovskite FAg ogEDAg o2Snl; is employed as the light active layer to fabricated PVSCs. For the preparation of FA, .,EDA,,2SnI,, about 0.9725 M perovskite precursor solution is prepared by mixing Snl,, FAI and EDADI in 1 mL DMF:DMSO (about 4:1/v:v) mixed solvent with a formula of FAo ssEDAoo2SnI3, about 12 mol % of excess SnFa and about 24 mg Sn powder is needed to suppress the Sn oxidation. The solution is stirred at room temperature for about 6~10 hours and is filtered through a 0.45 hm filter before use. Before spin-coating the perovskite solation, the solution is cooled down to from about 0~5\u00b0 C. for about 5~10 min. Then, about 60 HL perovskite solutions are spin-coated onto the ITO/HTL at from about 1200 rpm for about 5~20 s, subsequently at from about 5500 rpm for about 40 s. About 200 pL anti-solvent chlorobenzene is slowly dripped onto the center of perov- skite film at about 9 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films are subsequently annealed on a hotplate at from about 110\u00b0 C. for about 30 min.", "type": "Document"}}
