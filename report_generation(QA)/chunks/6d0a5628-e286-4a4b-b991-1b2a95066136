Furthermore, all percentages, ratios, etc. herein are by weight, unless specifically indicated otherwise. It is under- stood that unless otherwise specifically noted, the materials compounds, chemicals, etc. described herein are typically commodity items and/or industry-standard items available from a variety of suppliers worldwide.\n\n[0048] As used herein, \u201cITO\u201d refers to Indium Tin Oxide, \u201cPEN\u201d refers to Polyethylene Naphthalate, \u201cPET\u201d refers to Polyethylene Terephthalate, and \u201cFTO\u201d refers to Fluorine- doped Tin Oxide.\n\n[0049] As used herein, a single dash, \u201c-\u201d, or a double dash, \u201c=\u201d, may be used before and/or after terms to indicate the bond order of the bond between the stated substituent\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nand its parent moiety. A single dash represents a single bond, while a double dash represents a double bond. In the absence of a single or double dash, it is assumed that the substituent and its parent moiety form a single bond. Furthermore, unless a dash indicates otherwise, substituents are to be read \u201cleft to right.\u201d\n\n[0050] As used herein, band gap or band gap energy (Eg) refers to the minimum amount of energy required for an electron to break free of its bound state.\n\n1. Functionalized Fullerene Derivative\n\n[0051] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a functionalized fullerene derivative having a structure of Formula I below:\n\nFormula\n\nFormula I\n\n[0052] in which R is a monocyclic or polycyclic aro- matic ring comprising one or two nitrogen atoms.", "type": "Document"}}
