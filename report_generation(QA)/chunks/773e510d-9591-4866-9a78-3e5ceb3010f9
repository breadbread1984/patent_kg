In these methods, isolated mitochondria and cells were centrifuged together, which improved the mitochondria transfer efficiency by forcing mitochondria into the cells.\n\n[0009] U.S. Pat. No. 10,760,040B1 entitled: \u201cMechanical transfection devices and methods\u201d applies mechanical forces induced by the fluid to open the cell membrane and deliver isolated mitochondria into the cells.\n\n[0010] The traditional microinjection method causes physical harm to recipient cells. The co-culture technology is able to generate the number of cells required for cell therapy. However, the co-culture technology cannot control the number of mitochondria transferred into each recipient cell, so some cells that do not have enough mitochondria transferred may not be able to perform their full therapeutic function.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0011] Therefore, a mitochondrial transfer based on drop- et microfluidics system is provided as a high-efliciency quantitative mitochondrial transfer system. In the present invention, droplet microfluidics-based mitochondrial trans- er method causes only slight/minor physical harm to recipi- ent cells, which is unavoidable in microinjection, and shows high-throughput advantage. Compared with the traditional co-culture method, the proposed method could also control the number of mitochondria transferred to the recipient cells at the single-cell level, and achieve high efficiency and high throughput.\n\n[0012] The present invention provides a high-efliciency quantitative mitochondrial transfer based on a droplet micro- fluidics system. A droplet generation module configured to generate droplets containing isolated mitochondria and a single cell; a droplet observation module configured for observation of the generated droplets under a microscope; and a droplet collection module configured to collect the generated droplets.\n\n[0013] In another embodiment, the droplet generation and observation modules are connected by a conduit.", "type": "Document"}}
