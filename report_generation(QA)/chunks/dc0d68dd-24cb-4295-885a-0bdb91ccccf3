For example, Guo et al. reported the preparation of monodis- perse Rh,P nanoparticles via a colloidal method, in which the nanoparticles showed excellent HER performance in a wide pH range. In addition, Du et al. used a laser ablation method to synthesize compressed RhO, clusters embedded in Rh nanoparticles; the catalysis performance indicated that Rh-based noble metals are superior for alkaline HER. Nev- ertheless, the preparation methods/techniques employed in the aforementioned are complex, time-consuming, and expensive.\n\n[0005] Thus, there is a need in the art to develop an improved nanostructure and a simple, low-cost, and scalable method for fabricating such nanostructure. The present invention addresses this need.\n\n[0006] The following reference list sets forth the literature mentioned in this section, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety:\n\n[0007] 1.

The carbon shell is co-doped with sulfur and nitrogen nanoparticles. The obtained yolk-shell nanostructure has an overpotential of 10-20 mV at 10 mA cm\u201d, a Tafel slope of 20-30 mV dec\", a TOF of 0.1-0.3 sl at -75 mV/RHE, and a long-term durability more than 10 hours.", "type": "Document"}}
