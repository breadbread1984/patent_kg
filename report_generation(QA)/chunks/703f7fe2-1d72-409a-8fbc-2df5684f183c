The correlation between Voc and light intensity (I) is Vo\u00a2=(nkT/ e)In(I/I>+1), where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltz- mamm constant, and T is the temperature. The slope of the fitted curve is connected with the ideality factor (n) in the form of nkBT/q, which can be used to assess trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination in PVSCs. The n value reduces from 1.85 to 1.72 as introducing the Ceo-BPy interlayer, indicating that trap-assisted SRH recombination is inhibited.\n\n[0169] FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 show the Atom force micros- copy (AFM) of the control and the Ceo-BPy treated perov- skite films. The perovskite grain size and morphology do not change when the Ceo-BPy interlayer is deposited. However, the surface contact potential of the Ceo-BPy functionalized perovskite film exhibits a decreased average value (-100 mV) relative to that of the control sample as shown in FIG. 16 to FIG. 19. The inventors attribute the reduced contact potential to the surface charge transfer induced by the interaction between C,,.-BPy and perovskite. Moreover, the Cao-BPy functionalized perovskite displays a smaller poten- tial distribution and surface potential difference (-200 mV) than that of the control sample (-350 mV). A uniform distribution of surface contact potential is believed to be beneficial for effective charge carrier extraction and non- radiative recombination inhibition at perovskite grain boundaries.", "type": "Document"}}
