FIG. 3A shows the 3D rebuilding images of isolated mitochondria (labelled with MitoTracker\u2122 Green) encapsulated in one droplet at three different concentrations of isolated mito- chondrial suspension (cells stained with Cell Mask Deep Red were not shown here by closing the red color channel of confocal microscope). Every frame here contained one droplet, and the number of isolated mitochondria was labeled on the top left corner. FIG. 3B shows the number of isolated mitochondria encapsulated in each droplet at three different concentrations of isolated mitochondria suspen- sion. All data were presented as meanzSD.", "type": "Document"}}
