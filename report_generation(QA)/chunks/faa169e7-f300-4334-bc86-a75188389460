In particular, the electron is excited from a valence band of the semiconductor, across the bandgap, to a conduction band. The excited electron sits in the conduction band, and a corresponding hole (a vacancy or absence of an electron, rather than a physical particle in and of itself) remains in the valence band of the semiconductor.\n\n[0078] It is believed that an asymmetry within the perov- skite layer acts to separate the excited electron away from the hole, moving the charge carriers (holes and electrons) away from the point of electron promotion for collection and current generation. In the examples described herein, this asymmetry is provided by a junction within the perovskite solar cell (such as an n-p or n-i-p junction for solar cell, or a p-n or p-i-n junction for inverted solar cell). In other words, the perovskite solar cell can include any suitable semiconductor junction.\n\n[0079] In some embodiments, the perovskite layer can include one or more heterojunctions. Heterojunctions can be formed within the perovskite layer by way of two different, undoped, perovskite materials. Thus, the perovskites referred to herein may both be undoped semiconductors. Alternatively, the perovskite may be doped with p-type or n-type dopants to form a junction. In other words, they may\n\nJun. 6, 2024", "type": "Document"}}
