First, the mitochondria of donor C2C12 cells were stained with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM (Invitrogen\u2122, M7514). Second, the stained cells were washed three times with PBS, detached from the culture flask with Trypsin/EDTA Solution (Gibco\u2122, RO01100), and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes. Third, the supernatant was removed, and the collected cells were resuspended with 1 ml of cell lysis reagent (Beyotime, 3601-1) and placed in ice bath for 15 minutes. Fourth, the lysed cells were homogenized with a glass homogenizer for 30 cycles. Fifth, the homogenized cells were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Then, the supernatant was resuspended with 1 ml of cell lysis reagent (Beyotime, C3601-1) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. again for more purity. Finally, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3,500 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The pellet collected was the isolated mitochondria. Mitochondria stor- age reagent (Beyotime, C3601-3) was used to suspend the isolated mitochondria at the required concentration for fur- ther experiments. The mitochondria isolated from 110\u00b0 cells and suspended in 10 WL of mitochondria storing reagent was set as one unit of mitochondrial suspension.\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\n3D Reconstruction of Cells and Mitochondria Under Confocal Fluorescence Microscope", "type": "Document"}}
