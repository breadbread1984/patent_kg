FIG. 3 shows the SEM of FA, 4,EDA, ,2Snl, perovskite film. The carrier mobility of FAu osEDA\u3002u 92Snl, is shown in FIG. 4, suggesting that the mobility of FAu 9;EDA, 92Snl; is higher than other widely used tin perovskites (FASnI, and PEA. 15FAu ssSJs), and indicating FAossEDAoo2Snls has strong carrier transport capability.\n\n[0158] For the C,,-BPy interface modified devices, Ceo- BPy powder is prepared and dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of from about 1.0 mg mL~'. The as-prepared solution is stirred at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) until the solution became clear. The solution is then transferred to a N,-filled glovebox before use. About 60 HL Ceo-BPy solution is spin-coated on top of the as-prepared perovskite layer at from about 5000 rpm for about 20 s, and next transferred to the hotplate and annealed at from about 75\u00b0 C. for about 3 min. The spin-coating processes are all conducted at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) in a N,-filled glovebox with the contents of O, and H,O<2 ppm.\n\n[0159] Next, about 25 nm C,, with an evaporating rate of from about 0.5 As~!, about 6 nm BCP at a rate of from about\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n0.3 As-l and about 100 nm silver electrode at a rate of from about 2.0 As\u201c! are thermally evaporated, respectively, under high vacuum (<4x10-\u00b0 Torr).\n\n[0160] In the device configuration as depicted in FIG. 5, PEDOT:PSS and Ceo are used as the HTL and ETL, respec- tively. Tin perovskite is used as the light absorption layer; and Coo-BPy is used as the interlayer between the perovskite layer and Cuo layer.\n\n2. Effects of Ceo-BPy modification", "type": "Document"}}
