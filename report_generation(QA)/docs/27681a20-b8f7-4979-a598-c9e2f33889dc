In muscle tis- sues, when heteroplasmy exceeds a certain level or the mitochondria becomes dysfunctional, less ATP and exces- sive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, which can trigger muscle atrophy, weakness, and loss of endurance. Previous clinical and preclinical animal studies demonstrated links between increased mitochondrial dam- age and poor skeletal muscle health. Since 1990s, cell therapy, especially myoblast transplantation, has been pro- posed to improve the regeneration of injured skeletal muscles. However, failure of early clinical trials with myo- blast transplantation has been observed due to host immune cells such as CD8+ T lymphocytes causing massive cell death. The accumulation of immune cells produces sarco- Jemma damage, induces activation of caspase 3 in myofi- bers, and further induces apoptosis in muscle fibers. There- fore, new approaches, such as macrophages regulation and chemical induction of stem cells, need to be developed to treat skeletal muscle disorders. Restoring or improving mitochondrial functions to facilitate muscle regeneration is an attractive approach.\n\n[0003] Apart from energy production for cells, the mito- chondria can influence cell proliferation, aging, apoptosis, innate immunity, calcium homeostasis, and even stem cell differentiation potential. Mutations of mtDNA impair the functions of cells and tissues. It is observed that spontaneous transfer of mitochondria can occur in nature between healthy and damaged cells via different mechanisms, which is believed to protect the damaged cells and restore their cellular function. Mitochondrial transfer is a technique to alter mtDNA in cells, and has attracted more and more attention since it was first reported by Clark and Shay. Mitochondrial transfer has already been used in cell therapy for mtDNA-related diseases. It is easier to perform and practically more efficient than other techniques modifying the mitochondrial genome, such as mitoZFNs and mitoTAL- ENs. Transferring exogenous mitochondria into recipient cells could also reduce the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA, and promote the restoration or improvement of cell and tissue functions. Previous studies showed that exog- enous isolated mitochondria could be delivered into cells via co-culture or microinjection. In the method of co-culture with isolated mitochondria, the isolated mitochondria are engulfed by the recipient cells via endocytosis, which is a kind of cellular activity to uptake objects ranging from nanometers to several micrometers from the surrounding environment. The isolated mitochondria randomly move around the recipient cell and have chances to be engulfed by the cell when contacting it; this phenomenon could be\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\nregarded as a random and sporadic process. The transfer efficiency of co-culture method is influenced by the quantity of extracellular isolated mitochondria. Though it could reach the highest at 28% in a previous study, the number of transferred mitochondria is considerably heterogeneous (1-60 mitochondria per recipient cells) even when subjected to an equal amount of isolated mitochondria. Despite being a rather simple process, the success of the co-culture method is dependent on many uncontrollable factors that underlie the unsatisfactory cell metabolism recovery rate of recipient cells in previous work (~0.2%). An automated optical twee- zers-based manipulation system (OT-based manipulation system) was used for qualitative and quantitative mitochon- drial transfer to reduce influences from uncontrollable fac- tors. The OT-based system could precisely pick up the healthy mitochondria and transport them to the target recipi- ent cell. However, this method suffers from the limitation of low throughput, which makes it difficult to be used for clinical applications.\n\n[0004] Unlike co-culture methods, microinjection injects the isolated mitochondria preloaded in a microneedle directly into the recipient cells; thus, it may cause damage to the recipient cells owing to the cell membrane opening during the delivery process. In addition, the throughput of the microinjection technique is low.\n\n[0005] All the methods mentioned above provide useful tools for studying the mechanism of cell functions\u2019 resto- ration or improvement upon mitochondrial transfer. How- ever, they still could not fulfill the demand of a large quantity of mitochondria-transferred recipient cells in the cell therapy industry. The co-culture technique shows considerable advantage due to being harmless, but its low efliciency and heterogeneity are still a major bottleneck.\n\n[0006] Droplet microfluidics is a technology that disperses continuous flow carrying chemical reagents, cells, or other biomaterials into discrete volumes at micrometer scale, called droplets. These droplets are the basic unit for further chemical reactions, cell life activities, target detections, and material synthesis. Droplet microfluidics provides a much smaller and constrained environment than the bulk volume method, thus allowing more rapid reaction and detection of molecules/particles and interactions with encapsulated cells. Previous works have demonstrated that the droplet genera- tion rates could be as high as thousands of droplets per second, making droplet microfluidics a high-throughput technique intrinsically. An important application of droplet microfluidics is single-cell analysis, in which a single cell is encapsulated in one droplet for analyzing cell life activities or cell modification, such as antibody analysis or gene editing.\n\n[0007] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2017/ 159017A1 entitled: \u201cMethod for introducing exogenous mitochondria into a mammalian cell\u201d and US patent U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/149778A1 entitled: \u201cMethod and Applications of Peptide-Mediated Mitochon- drial Delivery System\u201d applies natural cell membrane engulfing processes also known as endocytosis to transfer isolated mitochondria.\n\n[0008] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2019/ 276852A1 entitled: \u201cMethod for delivering exogenous mito- chondria into cells\u201d and Europe Patent Application Publi- cation No. EP3169338A1 entitled: \u201cMethods for the intercellular transfer of isolated mitochondria in recipient cells\u201d apply the centrifugation method to transfer mitochon-\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\ndria.

The co-culture technology is able to generate the number of cells required for cell therapy. However, the co-culture technology cannot control the number of mitochondria transferred into each recipient cell, so some cells that do not have enough mitochondria transferred may not be able to perform their full therapeutic function.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0011] Therefore, a mitochondrial transfer based on drop- et microfluidics system is provided as a high-efliciency quantitative mitochondrial transfer system. In the present invention, droplet microfluidics-based mitochondrial trans- er method causes only slight/minor physical harm to recipi- ent cells, which is unavoidable in microinjection, and shows high-throughput advantage. Compared with the traditional co-culture method, the proposed method could also control the number of mitochondria transferred to the recipient cells at the single-cell level, and achieve high efficiency and high throughput.\n\n[0012] The present invention provides a high-efliciency quantitative mitochondrial transfer based on a droplet micro- fluidics system.

A droplet generation module 10 is configured to generate droplets 40 containing isolated mitochondria and a single cell. The droplet generation module 10 also comprises a wave-like structure which is configured to focus randomly distributed cells from the inlet to a line to improve the single cell encapsulation ratio and suppress the multiple cell encap- sulation ratio. Element 20 is a droplet observation module configured for observation of the generated droplets under a microscope (not shown). Element 30 is a droplet collection module configured to collect the generated droplets 40. The droplet generation and observation modules may be con- nected by a conduit 50. Optionally, the system 1 is disposed. on a chip 60 as seen in FIG. 1F.\n\nMicrofluidic Chip Fabrication and Operations\n\n[0038] The designed chip was fabricated using soft-lithog- raphy. Prior to experiments, the chip channels were coated with a surface modification agent to make them hydrophobic for stable water-in-oil droplet generation and transporting.\n\nCell Culture\n\n[0039] C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco modi- fied Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Gibco\u2122, 11965084) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco\u2122, 12800058) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco\u2122, 15240096) at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO,\n\nMitochondria Isolation\n\n[0040] The mitochondria used in this work were freshly isolated from C2C12 myoblasts cells by following the protocol of mitochondria isolation kit (Beyotime, C3601) before each mitochondrial transfer experiment. First, the mitochondria of donor C2C12 cells were stained with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM (Invitrogen\u2122, M7514). Second, the stained cells were washed three times with PBS, detached from the culture flask with Trypsin/EDTA Solution (Gibco\u2122, RO01100), and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes. Third, the supernatant was removed, and the collected cells were resuspended with 1 ml of cell lysis reagent (Beyotime, 3601-1) and placed in ice bath for 15 minutes. Fourth, the lysed cells were homogenized with a glass homogenizer for 30 cycles. Fifth, the homogenized cells were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Then, the supernatant was resuspended with 1 ml of cell lysis reagent (Beyotime, C3601-1) and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. again for more purity. Finally, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3,500 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The pellet collected was the isolated mitochondria. Mitochondria stor- age reagent (Beyotime, C3601-3) was used to suspend the isolated mitochondria at the required concentration for fur- ther experiments. The mitochondria isolated from 110\u00b0 cells and suspended in 10 WL of mitochondria storing reagent was set as one unit of mitochondrial suspension.\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\n3D Reconstruction of Cells and Mitochondria Under Confocal Fluorescence Microscope\n\n[0041] After co-culturing the recipient cells and exog- enous isolated mitochondria in droplets for 2 hours, the droplets were loaded into the observation module, as shown in FIG. 1A. Then, the confocal fluorescence microscope (LEICA SP8LIA++ TRUE Confocal Laser Scanning Micro- scope) was used to take a slice of droplets containing single cells (labelled with Cell Mask Deep Red) and isolated mitochondria (labelled with MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM). Afterwards, 3D reconstruction of the taken slices was con- ducted using the confocal microscopy software. Finally, the isolated mitochondria transferred into the cell were counted as the green particles inside the red cell region, and the green particles outside the red cell region were counted as the un-transferred isolated mitochondria. Mitochondrial transfer efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the transferred mitochondria to the total mitochondria inside the droplet. The same process was repeated for cells recovered from droplets to count the number of mitochondria transferred under different concentration of isolated mitochondria con- centration used.\n\nDroplet Rupture and Cell Collection\n\n[0042] The collected droplets floated on the top the fluo- rinated oil. Before the droplets broke, the extra oil on the bottom of the tube was removed. Then, 1 ml of 50% 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctanol (PFO, Thermo Scientific\u2122, AAB2015609) was added to the tube containing the col- lected droplets and gently vortexed for 1 minute for the droplets to merge into a bulk solution. Afterwards, the upper bulk solution was carefully moved to a new tube and centrifuged at 300 g for 3 minutes to collect the cells.\n\nMyogenic Differentiation of C2C12\n\n[0043] For evaluating C2C12 differentiation, 5,000 cell/ cm? were seeded in a six-well plate and cultured in growth media until reaching 80% confluence. The media were then replaced with DMEM (Gibco\u2122, 11965084) supplemented with 2% horse serum (Gibco\u2122, 16050130). The cells were kept in differentiation medium until the end of the assay, typically between day 5 to day 7. Myotube formation was monitored every two days. The time-points were days 0, 3, and 7.\n\nMIT Assay\n\n[0044] The cell proliferation rate of each C2C12 cell group was determined by MTT assay. In brief, C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cell/cm? in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were treated with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 100 wL, 0.5 mg/mL) for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The produced dark blue formazan crystals were solubilized by 100 nL DMSO. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader.\n\n[0045] In use, the developed droplet-based mitochondria transfer system of FIG. 1A employs. Three kinds of solu- tions such as (1) mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell sus- pension, (2) isolated mitochondria suspension, and (3) sur- factant-added fluorinated oil. Then, mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell suspension, isolated mitochondria suspension, and surfactant-added fluorinated oil (Sphere Fluidics, C021)\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\nare loaded into the droplet generation module 10 via three inlets. After that, the generated droplets are collected in the droplet collection module 30. Where the droplets include mitochondria, mitochondrial recipient cell, and mitochon- drial recipient cell with mitochondria inside.\n\n[0046] As shown in FIG. 1B and 1C, the flow-focusing structure is used to separate the two suspensions into drop- lets. The two suspensions are mitochondrial recipient C2C12 cell suspension and isolated mitochondria suspen- sion. A wave-like structure is adapted to focus the randomly distributed cells from the inlet to a line as shown FIG. 1D. Thus, the single-cell encapsulation efficiency can be improved. The isolated mitochondria are taken up by the recipient C2C12 cells via endocytosis inside the droplets, as indicated in FIG. 1E. The droplet generation and observation modules are connected via a PE tubing (BD Intramedic\u2122, BD 427406), and the whole fabricated chip is only approxi- mately 8 cm in length as shown in FIG. 1F. After mitochon- drial transfer is completed, the recipient cells are collected from the droplets via a droplet rupture process, and func- tional experiments could be immediately performed to assess the effect of mitochondrial transfer at different num- bers on C2C12 cell myogenic differentiation in-vitro, as indicated in FIG. 1G.\n\n[0047] For the observation and 3D rebuilding under a confocal fluorescence microscope (LEICA SP8LIA++ TRUE Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope), MitoTracker\u2122 Green FM (Invitrogen\u2122, M7514) at a con- centration of 2 uM is used to stain the mitochondria before isolation from donor cells.\n\n[0048] As presented in FIGS. 2A-2C, after mitochondria isolation, the mitochondria recipient cells and the freshly isolated mitochondria are loaded into the microfluidic chip immediately for the encapsulation and mitochondrial trans- fer process. The labelled isolated mitochondria in suspen- sion are spherical-like structures with a diameter of around 1 hm as shown in FIG. 2D. After 2 hours of co-culture in the generated droplets, FIG. 2E shows that the isolated mito- chondria are taken up by the recipient cells via endocytosis.\n\n[0049] As mentioned above, the cell encapsulation efli- ciency is improved beyond the Poisson distribution by using the wave-like structure. FIG. 2F shows that the single-cell encapsulation efliciency is able to reach approximately 47.8%, while the multiple-cell encapsulation ratio is sup- pressed to approximately 5.9% at a situation while using cell concentration of 0.85x107 cell/mL and a cell suspension flow rate of 300 uL/30 mins (the flow rate of isolated mitochondria suspension was maintained to be the same). This implies that the single-to-multiple cell encapsulation ratio is increased to 8.1. In other words, 292% of the Poisson distribution (at the condition of cells encapsulated per drop- let was 0.6). Such improvement in single-cell encapsulation efficiency is able to help increase the throughput. The proposed system is able to notably yield 2x10 recipient cells in droplets for mitochondria transfer in 30 minutes. As shown in FIG. 2H, the mitochondrial transfer efficiency, defined as the ratio of the isolated mitochondria transferred into the cell to the total isolated mitochondria encapsulated. in the droplet, decreased slightly from 75% to 70% with the increase in droplet diameter from 40 hm to 52 um. As shown, in FIG. 2G, the droplet diameter is set to 40 hm by setting the flow rate ratio of oil/water phase to 6. As shown in FIG. 2I, after processing with the developed system, the viability\n\nUS 2023/0407336 Al\n\nof the recipient cells can still be kept relatively high, such as 95% at a flow rate of 300 uL/30 mins.\n\n[0050] The closed microenvironment of droplets limits the travelling distance of isolated mitochondria and increases the probability of the isolated mitochondria to contact with the cell, thereby making mitochondria taken up by the cell easily, and improving the mitochondria transfer efliciency. Moreover, due to the smaller size of isolated mitochondria than that of the droplets (1-40 hm in diameter), the isolated mitochondria are evenly encapsulated in each droplet. The number of isolated mitochondria encapsulated in droplets can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of isolated mitochondria suspension. FIGS. 3A-3B show that 8, 22, and 41 isolated mitochondria are encapsulated in each droplet at 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 unit concentrations of isolated mitochon- dria suspension used, respectively. The 1.0 unit of concen- tration refers to mitochondria isolated from 1x10\u00b0 cells and suspended in 10 hL mitochondrial storing reagent (Beyo- time, C3601-3).\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n[0051] In one embodiment, three different concentrations of isolated mitochondrial suspension (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration) are used to verify the transfer effi- ciency of the present invention. FIGS. 4A and 4B show that under 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration used, 8, 14, and 31 isolated mitochondria are transferred into the recipi- ent cells on average, respectively. FIG. 4C shows that under 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 units of concentration used, the mitochon- drial transfer efficiency is approximately 75%.\n\n[0052] Myogenesis assay is performed to test the differ- entiation ability of C2C12 myoblasts after mitochondrial transfer with the proposed droplet microfluidics-based method. After 7 days of induction, FIGS. 5A-5C show that the myotube area and length (as indicators of myogenesis) are significantly increased in the high-mito transferred group (31 exogenous isolated mitochondria transferred per cell) compared with the control, low-mito, and mid-mito trans- ferred groups (corresponding to 0, 8 and 14 exogenous isolated mitochondria transferred per cell, respectively). Moreover, MTT assay indicates 2.5 and 1.5 times increase in cell proliferation on day 4 in the high and mid-mito transferred groups, respectively, as shown in FID. 5D.\n\nIndustrial Applicability\n\n[0053] The present invention provides a mitochondrial transfer based on droplet microfluidics system is provided as a high-efficiency quantitative mitochondrial transfer system due to the following advantages:\n\n[0054] The number of mitochondria needed to be trans- ferred into recipient cells is an import issue in precise medicine. The development of the presented invention, which can achieve a precise quantity-control on mitochon- drial transfer at the single cell level, can help us to determine the mitochondria number needed to make a significant function improvement on the recipient cells before conduct- ing the cell therapy for mtDNA-related diseases.\n\n[0055] Compared to existing mitochondrial transfer meth- ods, the invented method can produce massive quantitative mitochondria transferred cells for cell therapy purpose. Although the co-culture with isolated mitochondria method can also produce the number of cells needed for cell therapy, it cannot control the number of mitochondria transferred into\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\neach recipient cell, thus, some cells without enough mito- chondria transferred may cannot fully play their therapeutic functions. However, using the invented system, the mito- chondria transferred into each recipient cell is controlled, thus, the cells used for cell therapy can fully play their therapeutic functions.\n\n[0056] While the present disclosure has been described and illustrated with reference to specific embodiments thereof, these descriptions and illustrations are not limiting.
