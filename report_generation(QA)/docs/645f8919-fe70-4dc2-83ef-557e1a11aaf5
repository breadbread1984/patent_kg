However, the perceived toxicity of lead in the state-of-the-art perov- skite solar cells (PVSCs) remains an issue that must be addressed on the path towards commercialization. As an alternative to lead halide perovskites, tin perovskites out- perform other lead-free perovskite candidates due to a avorable band gap, low exciton-bind energy, and high carrier mobility. Despite the rapid development of tin VSCs, there is still a substantial efficiency difference between tin and lead perovskite photovoltaics, leading to a massive energy loss. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective strategies to reduce the energy loss of environment- friendly tin PVSCs.\n\n[0004] Long-term stability of tin PVSCs is another chal- lenging issue to the commercialization. As such, it is desir- able to develop new tin PVSCs with both improved PCE and stability.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0005] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a tin-based perovskite solar cell (PVSC) including a surface treatment layer containing a functionalized fullerene deriva- tive having a structure of formula I below:\n\nFormula I\n\nFormula I\n\n[0006] in which R is a monocyclic or polycyclic aro- matic ring including one or two nitrogen atoms.\n\n[0007] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing a tin-based PVSC including the steps of:\n\n[0008] providing a substrate;\n\n[0009] coating a hole transport layer onto the substrate;\n\nand\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n[0010] preparing a perovskite layer including the step of coating a perovskite precursor solution containing a tin-based perovskite composition onto the hole trans- port layer , in which the tin-based perovskite compo- sition has the empirical formula: Cs,EDA,FA ,_,.2,Snl;\n\n[0011] in which x is from about 0 to about 0.12;\n\n[0012] in which y is from about 0.01 to about 0.03;\n\n[0013] in which FA is formamidinium;

Functionalized Fullerene Derivative\n\n[0051] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a functionalized fullerene derivative having a structure of Formula I below:\n\nFormula\n\nFormula I\n\n[0052] in which R is a monocyclic or polycyclic aro- matic ring comprising one or two nitrogen atoms.\n\n[0053] Without intending to be limited by theory it is belived that the interface functionalization using the fuller- ene derivatives can strongly anchor on the perovskite sur- face via coordination interactions between the functionaliz- ing moiety on the derivatives and the Sn?* ion, which not only passivates the perovskite surface defects, but also regulates the interface energy level alignment to reduce non-radiative recombination.\n\n[0054] In some embodiments, R in Formula | is a mono- cyclic aromatic ring selected from the group of pyrazine, pyridine, and a combination thereof. In some embodiments, R is not pyridine. In an embodiment herein, the monocyclic aromatic ring is preferably pyridine because it can form strong binding with Pb ions in perovskite, which can pas- sivate Pb related defects.\n\n[0055] In some embodiments, R in Formula I is a poly- cyclic aromatic ring selected from the group of isoquinoline, naphthyridine, and a combination thereof.\n\n[0056] In some embodiments, the functionalized fullerene derivative has a structure selected from the group of:\n\na)\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\n-continued\n\nQ)\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n(G3)\n\n(6)\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n-continued\n\na)\n\n(8)\n\n@)\n\n(10)\n\nUD\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\ncontinued\n\nan > and\n\n(13)\n\n[0057] In some embodiments, the functionalized fullerene derivative has a structure selected from any of formulae (3) to (13) as listed above. In some embodiments, the function- alized fullerene derivative has a structure of formula (1), which also referred to as Ceo-BPy herein. Without being limited by alkyl chain. Pyridine can better combine fullerene molecules with tin-based perovskites and improve their mutual binding force. Furthermore, it is believed that long alkyl chains can increase the robustness of perovskite films, thereby improving device reliability.\n\n[0058] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing the functionalized fullerene derivative described above, which includes the following steps:\n\n[0059] adding N-butyl glycine (about 0.006~0.024 mol/ L, preferably about 0.016 mol/L) and a precursor compound to a solution of fullerene (C,,; about 0.003~0.012 mol/L, preferably about 0.008 mol/L) in chlorobenzene with a molar ratio of N-butyl glycine to Coo being about 2:1;\n\n[0060] heating the mixture at about 65~95\u00b0 C. (prefer- ably 80\u00b0 C.) under a nitrogen atmosphere for about 5 h; and\n\n[0061] removing the solution.\n\n[0062] Without being bonding to theory, it is believed that the materials synthesized within the above-mentioned parameters have higher purity and better stability. If the ratio of N-butyl glycine to Coo does not conform to 2:1, it will lead to the increase of impurities and the decrease of synthesis yield. If the material concentration is too high or the mixture is heated at a higher temperature than the above, the reaction rate may be too fast, resulting in agglomeration of the synthesis product, which is not conducive to later use.\n\n[0063] In some embodiments, the precursor compound is selected from the group of n-butyl-pyridine, 4-pyridinecar- boxaldehyde, nicotinaldehyde, pyrazine-2-carbaldehyde, 5-methylpyrazine-2-carbaldehyde, quinoline-8-carbalde- hyde, is oquinoline-8-carbaldehyde, quinoline-4-carbalde- hyde, quinoline-5-carbaldehyde, quinoline-7-carbaldehyde,\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nguinoline-3-carbaldehyde, quinoline-6-carbaldehyde, 1,8- naphthyridine-4-carbaldehyde, and 1,8-naphthyridine-3-car- baldehyde. In an embodiment herein, the precursor com- pound is preferably n-butyl-pyridine.\n\n[0064] Insome embodiments, the mixture is monitored by thin layer chromatography during the heating step. In some embodiments, the removing of the solution is performed after cooling to room temperature and under reduced pres- sure. In some embodiments, the process further comprise the step of purifying the resulted product via silica gel column chromatography.\n\n(13) 2. Perovskite Composition\n\n[0065] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a tin-based perovskite composition having the empirical formula: Cs,EDA,FA,_,.2,Snl, in which x is from about 0 to about 0.12; y is from about 0.01 to about 0.03; FA is formamidinium; and EDA is ethylenediamine. For example, in the empirical formula, x may be about 0, and y may be about 0.02.\n\n[0066] In some embodiments, the tin-based perovskite composition has any of the following empirical formulae: FA 6EDAo oaSnl\u3002 ; C89 12EDAo.o3F Ap g2Snlz; EDA. oIFAu oosSnla: and CsooeEDAooisFAosiSnls.\n\n[0067] Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the tin-based perovskite composition of this invention contains EDA?* ions, which can better stabilize the tin-based perovskite crystal structure and improve the stability of tin-based perovskite devices, compared with traditional tin-based perovskite (Cs,FA,_.PbI,).\n\n[0068] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing a perovskite precursor solution, which includes the following steps:\n\n[0069] mixing SnI,, FAI, CsI and EDADI in DMF: DMSO mixed solvent in certain amount to meet the empirical formula of Cs,EDA,FA,_,.2,Snl; (where x is about 0~0.12, and y is about 0.010.03); and.\n\n[0070] _ stirring the perovskite precursor solution.\n\n[0071] In some embodiments, about 0.85 M to about 1.0 M perovskite precursor solution is prepared by mix the raw materials in 1 mL DMF:DMSO (about 3:1 to 5:1 /v:v) mixed. solvent. In some embodiments, about 10 mol % to about 15 mol % of excess SnF, and about 20 mg to about 30 mg Sn powder is added into the solution to suppress the Sn oxida- tion. The solution is stirred at room temperature for about 6 h to about 10 h and is filtered through a 0.45 jum filter before use.\n\n3. Perovskite Solar Cell (PVSC)\n\n[0072] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a perovskite solar cell, in particular an inverted perovskite solar cell, including a surface treatment layer containing a a functionalized fullerene derivative having a structure of Formula I described herein.\n\n[0073] Among perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), it is believed that inverted (p-n/p-i-n structure) devices have typically exhibited more stable behaviour than conventional (n-p/n-i-p) PVSCs, due in part to their non-doped hole transporting materials and highly crystalline perovskite films. The following description is with primary reference to inverted PVSCs, but the beneficial effects of an interface\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nlayer (i.e., a surface treatment layer described herein after) as described herein apply equally to a conventional PVSC structure.\n\nSubstrate\n\n[0074] In some embodiments, the perovskite solar cell includes a substrate, which forms the base or support for the solar cell structure. Visible light (such as incident sunlight) enters the solar cell through the substrate.\n\n[0075] In some embodiment, the substrate is transparent and may be formed of glass, or any other suitable transparent material. In some embodiments, the substrate includes a material selected from the group of ITO/Glass, ITO/PEN, ITO/PET, FTO/Glass, FTO/PEN, FTO/PET, and a combi- nation thereof. In an embodiment herein, the substrate is preferably ITO. Compared with PEN and PET, ITO sub- strate has higher transmittance and higher device efficiency. Compared with FTO, it is believed that ITO-based devices are thinner and lighter, making it easier to transport and install.\n\nPerovskite Layer\n\n[0076] In some embodiments, the perovskite solar cell includes a perovskite layer, which is the active or functional layer of the solar cell. In other words, the perovskite layer is the light-absorbing layer of the solar cell. The term light- absorbing\u2019 in relation to the perovskite(s) (and by extension the perovskite layer 30 comprising one or more perovskites) refers to its role in absorbing light, e.g. visible light, so as to act as a light absorbing material which allows to convert the light into electrical energy. A perovskite type compound exhibits strong absorption with respect to visible light inci- dent on the solar cell, and the bandgap of a perovskite semiconductor can be tuned to a desired band gap energy (Eg), thereby improving the efficiency of such solar cells.\n\n[0077] As in the exemplar solar cell depicted in FIG. 5a, solar radiation or visible light passes through the substrate 10 into the perovskite layer 30, whereupon at least a portion of the solar radiation is absorbed by exciting an electron across a semiconductor band gap so as to enable electrical generation. In particular, the electron is excited from a valence band of the semiconductor, across the bandgap, to a conduction band. The excited electron sits in the conduction band, and a corresponding hole (a vacancy or absence of an electron, rather than a physical particle in and of itself) remains in the valence band of the semiconductor.\n\n[0078] It is believed that an asymmetry within the perov- skite layer acts to separate the excited electron away from the hole, moving the charge carriers (holes and electrons) away from the point of electron promotion for collection and current generation. In the examples described herein, this asymmetry is provided by a junction within the perovskite solar cell (such as an n-p or n-i-p junction for solar cell, or a p-n or p-i-n junction for inverted solar cell). In other words, the perovskite solar cell can include any suitable semiconductor junction.\n\n[0079] In some embodiments, the perovskite layer can include one or more heterojunctions. Heterojunctions can be formed within the perovskite layer by way of two different, undoped, perovskite materials. Thus, the perovskites referred to herein may both be undoped semiconductors. Alternatively, the perovskite may be doped with p-type or n-type dopants to form a junction. In other words, they may\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nbe doped (throughout and/or at the surface) with at least one dopant material of greater valence than the bulk material (to provide n-type doping) and/or may be doped with at least one dopant material of lower valence than the bulk material (to give p-type doping). N-type doping will tend to increase the n-type character of the semiconductor material, while p-type doping will tend to reduce the degree of the natural n-type state (e.g. due to defects). Such doping may be made with any suitable material including F, Sb, N, Ge, Si, C, In, InO and/or Al. Suitable dopants and doping levels will be evident to those of skill in the art.\n\n[0080] In some embodiments, the light-absorbing perov- skite layer comprises one or more metal halide perovskites. For example, the metal halide perovskites may have a structure of ABX,, where the A-site ions can be selected from the group of FA*, MA\u2018, Cs*, and Rb*, and B-site ions can be selected from the group of Pb?*, Sn?*, Bi*, and Ag*, and X-site ions can be selected from the group of F-, Cl\u2019, Br\u2019, and I-. In some examples, the light-absorbing perov- skite layer may comprise two different metal halide perov- skites configured to form a semiconductor heterojunction within the perovskite layer. Any perovskite capable of performing the desired light-absorbing and charge separa- tion functions may be used in the light-absorbing perovskite layer.\n\nHole Transport Layer (HTL)\n\n[0081] In some embodiment, the solar cell may further includes a hole transport layer (i.e., p-type charge-extraction layer) comprising or consisting of one or more hole transport materials. In an inverted PVSC, for example, as shown in FIG. 5a, the HTL (the hole transport layer 20) is located proximate to the transparent substrate 10 (holes are collected at the electrode proximate the substrate, converse to the conventional PVSC).\n\n[0082] Any hole-transport material known to the skilled person may be used. Example hole transport materials include but is not limited to organic hole-transport materials, inorganic hole-transport materials or combinations thereof. Organic hole-transport materials may be polymeric or non- polymeric. Exemplary polymeric hole-transport materials include polythiophenes, for example poly (3-hexylthi- ophene) (P3HT); p oly (arylamines) for example Poly [bis (4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA); \u2014 and doped PEDOT, for example Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio- phene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Exemplary non-polymeric organic hole-transport materials are com- pounds containing one or more arylamine groups, for example spiro-OMeTAD. Examplary inorganic hole-trans- port materials include copper-based materials (e.g. Cuac, CuSCN, Cul, etc.), nickel-based materials (e.g. NiO,), two- dimensional layered materials such as chalcogens (e.g. MoS;, WS,, etc.). Hole transport materials encourage a flow of holes from the p-type perovskite, away from the junction within the perovskite layer, while block the movement of electrons.\n\n[0083] In some embodiments, the hole transport layer includes a material selected from the group of PEDOT:PSS, PTAA, and a combination thereof. It is believed that, these materials with excellent hole transport ability are also mature commercial hole transport materials, and therefore are readily available for industrial production.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nElectron Transport Layer (ETL)\n\n[0084] In some embodiments, the solar cell may further includes an electron transport layer (le., n-type charge- extraction layer). The ETL comprises an electron transport material. Any electron transport material known to the skilled person may be used. The ETL may comprise or consist of an organic electron transport material, an inor- ganic electron transport material or mixtures thereof. Example electron transport materials include organic mate- rials such as fullerenes, for example Ceo or Phenyl-C,,- butyric acid methyl ester (PCeiBM), metal oxides such as TiO,, ZnO, SnO,. Electron transport materials may encour- age a flow of electrons from the n-type perovskite, away from the junction within the perovskite layer 30, while blocking the movement of holes. In this way, electrons accumulate at electron transport layer 50. In use, the electron transport layer 50 is negatively charged due to the accumu- ation of electrons. When the solar cell is connected to an external load, the electrons leave the solar cell via the electron transport layer 50.\n\n[0085] In some embodiments, the electron transport layer includes a material selected from the group of fullerene Ceo\uff0c TiO,, SnO,, Al,O;, PCeiBM, Phenyl-C,,-butyric acid methyl ester (PC;,BM), and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, the electron transport layer preferably includes PC,,BM. Without being bound to theory, it is believed that PC,,BM can passivate the defects in the perovskite functional layer and at the interface, and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the solar cell device. The PCBM interface modification layer is intro- duced to modify the interface at the electron transport layer/perovskite layer to improve the optoelectronic perfor- mance of the solar cell device. It is believed that the PCBM interface modification cannot completely eliminate the hys- teresis effect of the solar cell, so this invention dopes the PCBM material into the photovoltaic functional layer of the solar cell device to study the effect of the grain boundary gap on the solar cell performance.\n\nMetal Electrode\n\n[0086] In some embodiments, the solar cell may further includes a metal electrode. In some embodiments, the metal electrode is selected from the group of Ag, Au, Al, Cu and a combination thereof. In an embodiment herein, the metal electrode is preferably Ag or Au. In some embodiments, carbon can also be used as the electrode of the solar cell.\n\nTin-Based PVSC Structures\n\n[0087] In some embodiments, the above-described perov- skite solar cell may be a tin-based perovskite solar cell (PVSC).\n\n[0088] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC includes a perovskite layer containing a tin-based perovskite composition having the empirical formula CS,EDA,FA aySnl, as defined herein. Lax\n\n[0089] Without intending to be limited by theory it is belived that the present inveniton develops a synergistic strategy combining component optimization, crystallization regulation and interface functionalization to fabricate the high-efficiency and stable lead-free tin PVSCs. The compo- nent and crystallization manipulation can decrease the bulk defect density and suppresses the tin oxidation. In addition, it is believed that the fullerene derivatives such fullerene-\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nn-butyl-pyridine (Ceo-BPy) according to the invention, as an interface functionalization material, simultaneously enhance the efficiency and stability of tin PVSCs.\n\n[0090] In some embodiments, the surface treatment layer is in contact with one side of the perovskite layer.\n\n[0091] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention has a PCE of about 12.5% to about 14.5%. For example, the resulting devices according to the invention can achieve a PCE of about 14.14% with negli- gible hysteresis. In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC according to the invention maintains over about 95% of their initial PCE under continuous one-sun illumination for about 1000 hours.\n\n[0092] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention further includes the following layers:\n\n[0093] a substrate;\n\n[0094] optionally a first charge-extraction between the substrate and the perovskite layer; layer\n\n[0095] optionally a second charge-extraction layer on the surface treatment layer; and\n\n[0096] a metal electrode on the second charge-extrac- tion layer,\n\n[0097] wherein each of the first charge-extraction layer and the second charge-extraction layer\n\n[0098] could be either a hole transport layer or an electron transport layer.\n\n[0099] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention includes the hole transport layer, the electron transport layer, or the combination thereof. In some embodiment, the tin-based PVSC does not include the hole transport layer or the electron transport layer. In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC according to the inven- tion has any of the following structures: electrode/HTM/ perovskite/ETL/substrate, electrode/ETL/perovskite/HTM/ substrate, electrode/HTM/perovskite/substrate, electrode/ perovskite/ETL/substrate, in which the perovskite is covered by the surface treatment layer.\n\n[0100] In some embodiments, the tin-based PVSC accord- ing to the invention further includes the following layers:\n\n[0101] a substrate;\n\n[0102] a hole transport layer between the substrate and the perovskite layer;\n\n[0103] an electron transport layer on the surface treat- ment layer; and\n\n[0104] a metal electrode on the electron transport layer. [0105] In the PVSCs, the functional or active perovskite layer are sandwiched between the HTL and ETL. In other words, the charge transporting layers are deposited on the top and the bottom sides of the perovskite active layer, respectively. The charge carriers are extracted at the HTL/ perovskite and perovskite/ETL interfaces and collected through the respective conductors/contacts. During this pro- cess, the carrier charges may be subject to recombination, for example due to any interfacial defects and associated. specific charge distributions.\n\n[0106] Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that interface recombination arises from charge dynamics at the interface (including charge extraction, charge transfer, and charge recombination). The imperfect interfacial structural and electronic mismatches usually act as energy barriers for charge transport and charge recombi- nation. Furthermore, it is believed that defects at the surface and interface of polycrystalline perovskite films are mostly either positively charged or negatively charged. Trap states\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nat the perovskite surface and interfaces can lead to charge accumulation and recombination losses in the device.\n\n[0107] In some embodiment, the surface treatment layer is inserted between the perovskite layer and the electron trans- port layer. It has been surprisingly found that the perfor- mance of the perovskite solar cell described herein can be improved when the surface treatment layer comprising an interfacial compound (i.e., the functionalized fullerene derivative) as described herein is provided between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer. It is believed that such surface treatment layer can suppress defects in the perovskite surface and minimize interfacial non-radiative combination losses. In this way, the surface treatment layer improves the extraction of electrons at the perovskite interface, increases the efficiency of the solar cell, and improves the stability of the solar cell.\n\n[0108] In some embodiments, the surface treatment layer interfaces directly with the perovskite layer. In other words, the surface treatment layer and the perovskite layer are in direct contact. The surface treatment layer can be deposited directly on the active perovskite layer, as described below, or may be otherwise formed.\n\n[0109] The above-mentioned definitions and descriptions regarding the substrate, the hole transport layer, the perov- skite layer, and the electron transport layer also apply to the Tin-based PVSC structures herein.\n\n[0110] In certain embodiments, the PVSC structure of the present application includes: a conductive ITO substrate/a PEDOT:PSS layer/a tin perovskite layer/a Cao-BPy layer/a Co layer/a bathocuproine (BCP) layer/a metal counter elec- trode layer, see, for example, FIG. 5.\n\n[0111] Specifically, in the above structure, ITO is used as a substrate layer for the device, PEDOT:PSS and Ceo are used as the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL), respectively; Tin perovskite is used as the light absorption layer; Ceo-BPy is used as the interlayer between the perovskite layer and Coo.\n\nManufacture of Tin-Based PVSC\n\n[0112] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process of preparing a tin-based inverted PVSC, which includes the steps of:\n\n[0113] providing a substrate;\n\n[0114] coating a hole transport layer onto the substrate;\n\nand\n\n[0115] preparing a perovskite layer including the step of coating a perovskite precursor solution containing a tin-based perovskite composition onto the hole trans- port layer, in which the tin-based perovskite composi- tion has the empirical formula: Cs,EDA,FA,_,.2,Snl3, in which x is from about 0 to about 0.12; y is from about 0.01to about 0.03; FA is formamidinium; and EDA is ethylenediamine.\n\n[0116] Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that this process introduces EDA** ions, which can better stabilize the tin-based perovskite crystal structure and improve the stability of tin-based perovskite devices , and Cs+ can adjust the crystallization rate of perovskites for better processing, compared with traditional tin-based per- ovskite (Cs,FA, ,PbI,).\n\n[0117] In some embodiments, the substrate is subjected to the following treatment before coating the hole transport layer thereon: the substrate is sequentially cleaned by soni- cation with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopro-\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\npyl alcohol for about 10 min to about 30 min, respectively. Then, the substrate is dried at about 80\u00b0 C. to about 120\u00b0 C. in an oven, and then is treated with oxygen plasma for about 5 min to about 20 min and finally transferred into a N,-filled glovebox before use. The substrate may be an ITO substrate having a surface resistivity of from about 10 Qsq7' to about 45 Qsq7', preferably about 15 Qsq7'. Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the surface resistivity of the substrate is negatively correlated with the transmit- tance of the substrate. If the resistance is too large, then the charge transfer will be affected. If the resistance is too small, the light transmittance of the substrate is poor, reducing the device efficiency.\n\n[0118] In some embodiment, HTL materials (for example PEDOT:PSS) is filtered through a 0.45 hm filter and spin- coated on the substrate at from about 3500 rpm to about 4500 rpm (preferably about 4000 rpm) for about 50 s to 60 s (preferably 60 s), and then annealed at from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 10 min to about 20 min (preferably 15 min). It is believed that, under such conditions, the HTL layer will be produced with uniform and dense surface.\n\n[0119] In some embodiments, the process of preparing the tin-based inverted PVSC according to the invention further includes the step of:\n\n[0120] preparing a surface treatment layer by coating a solution containing a functionalized fullerene deriva- tive onto the perovskite layer, in which the function- alized fullerene derivative has a structure of formula I below:\n\nFormula I\n\nFormula R N\n\n[0121] in which R is a monocyclic or poly cyclic aromatic ring comprising one or two nitrogen atoms.\n\n[0122] Insome embodiments, the process of preparing the tin-based inverted PVSC according to the invention further includes the steps of:\n\n[0123] coating an electron transport layer onto the sur- face treatment layer, and\n\n[0124] coating a metal electrode onto the electron trans- port layer.\n\n[0125] In some embodiments, the step of preparing the perovskite layer includes:\n\n[0126] preparing the perovskite precursor solution by mixing Snl,, FAI, Cs] and EDADI in DMF:DMSO (about 3:1/v:v to about 5:1/v:v, preferably about 4:1/ v:v) mixed solvent with the empirical formula of Cs,E- DA,FA,_..2,Snl5;\n\n[0127] _ stirring the perovskite precursor solution at room temperature;\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\n[0128] coating the perovskite precursor solution onto the hole transport layer after cooling it down to from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 5\u00b0 C. (preferably about 0\u00b0 C.); and\n\n[0129] annealing at from about 90\u00b0 C. to about 160\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 7 min to about 50 min (preferably about 30 min).\n\n[0130] The difference in the boiling points of the two solvents (DMF:DMSO) is used to control the solvent ratio, which is believed to have influence on the volatilization rate of the precursor, and control the crystallization rate of the perovskite. It is believed that cooling down to from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 5\u00b0 C. may reduce the rate of solvent evaporation in the solution, and the annealing step above makes perov- skite crystals more complete, with uniform and dense sur- faces.\n\n[0131] In some embodiments, prior to stirring the perov- skite precursor solution, the solution is added with about 10 mol % to about 15 mol % of excess SnF, and about 20 mg to about 30 mg Sn powder to suppress the Sn oxidation. In some embodiments, the perovskite precursor solution is stirred for about 6 h to about 10 h.\n\n[0132] In some embodiments, the perovskite precursor solution is spin-coated at a rate from about 350 rpm to about 1800 rpm (preferably about 1250 rpm) for about 5 s to about 20 s (preferably about 10 s), subsequently at a rate from about 3500 rpm to about 7000 rpm (preferably about 5500 rpm) for about 30 s to about 60 s (preferably about 40 s). In some embodiments, about 30 WL to about 100 HL (preferably about 60 HL) perovskite precursor solution is spin coated under this condition. In some embodiments, the perovskite precursor solution has a concentration of from about 0.85 M to about 1.0 M (preferably 0.9725 M). In some embodi- ments, before the end of coating the the perovskite precursor solution, about 150 hL to about 300 hL (preferably about 200 tL) anti-solvent chlorobenzene is slowly dripped onto the center of perovskite film during about 5 s to about 18 s (preferably about 9 s). The as-prepared perovskite films are subsequently annealed on a hotplate at from about 90\u00b0 C. to about 160\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 7 min to about 50 min (preferably about 30 min). It is believed that the perovskite layer prepared under such conditions will form more complete perovskite crystals, and the layer may have a uniform and dense surface.\n\n[0133] In some embodiments, the step of preparing the surface treatment layer comprises:\n\n[0134] preparing the solution comprising the function- alized fullerene derivative at a concentration from about 0.5 mg mL~' to about 2.0 mg mL~' (preferably about 1.0 mg/mL);\n\n[0135] spin-coating the solution comprising the func- tionalized fullerene derivative onto the perovskite layer at from about 2500 rpm to 5500 rpm (preferably about 4000 rpm) for about 18 s to 30 s (preferably 30 s); and\n\n[0136] annealing at from about 85\u00b0 C. to about 135\u00b0 C. (preferably about 110\u00b0 C.) for about 1 min to about 10 min.\n\n[0137] Without intending to be limited by theory it is believed that the surface treatment layer prepared under such conditions will have a uniform and dense surface.\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n[0138] In some embodiments, the functionalized fullerene derivative contained in the surface treatment layer has a structure selected from the group of:\n\n(a\n\nQ)\n\nGB)\n\n4)\n\n6)\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\n-continued\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n-continued\n\n(1\n\n(2) , and\n\n(3) == 7, \\ \u4e00 \u4e00 \u4e8c \u4e4b\n\n[0139] For the Ceo-BPy interface modified devices, Ceo- BPy powder is prepared and dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of from about 0.5 mg mL to about 2.0 mg mL The as-prepared solution is stirred at room tempera- ture (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) until the solution became clear. The solution is then transferred to a N,-filled glovebox before use. About 50~120 pL C,,-BPy solution is spin- coated on top of the perovskite layer at from about 4000~6000 rpm for about 10~25 s, and next transferred to the hotplate and annealed at from about 60~80\u00b0 C. for about 2~5 min. The spin-coating processes are all conducted at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) in a N,-filled glovebox with the contents of O, and H,O<2 ppm.\n\n[0140] In some embodiments, after the surface treatment layer is coated, about 10~30 nm C,, with an evaporating rate of from about 0.3~1.5 As -1 , about 4~10 nm BCP at a rate of from about 0.2~1.2 As-1 and about 70~120 nm silver electrode at a rate of from about 0.5~3.0 As\u2122' are thermally evaporated, respectively, under high vacuum (<4x107\u00b0 Torr).\n\n[0141] In certain embodiments, the above-mentioned defi- nitions and descriptions regarding the substrate, the hole transport layer, the electron transport layer, and the electrode also apply to the process herein.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n[0142] The chemicals used include the following: Tin iodide (SnI,, 99.999%) and Tin fluoride (SnF,, 99%) are purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lan- cashire, United Kingdom, https://www.alfa.com/zh-cn/re- gions/).

Besides, other raw materials and synthesis methods remain unchanged.\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\nExample 2\n\nPerovskite Solar Cells\n\n1. Preparation of PVSCs\n\n[0153] The fabrication method of the tin PVSCs is as follows.\n\n[0154] The ITO substrates are sequentially cleaned by sonication with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for about 20 min, respectively. The ITO substrates have a surface resistivity of 15 Qsq7'. Then, the substrates are dried at about 110\u00b0 C. in an oven, and then are treated with oxygen plasma for about 15 min and finally transferred into a N,-filled glovebox before use.\n\n[0155] Next, for the preparation of HTL, PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution is filtered through a 0.45 wm filter and spin-coated on the substrate surface at from about 3500 rpm to about 4000 rpm for about 50 s to 60 s, and then annealed at from about 110\u00b0 C. for about 15 min to about 20 min.\n\n[0156] Then, suitable perovskite materials are coated on the HTL. The optimized tin perovskite FAg ogEDAg o2Snl; is employed as the light active layer to fabricated PVSCs. For the preparation of FA, .,EDA,,2SnI,, about 0.9725 M perovskite precursor solution is prepared by mixing Snl,, FAI and EDADI in 1 mL DMF:DMSO (about 4:1/v:v) mixed solvent with a formula of FAo ssEDAoo2SnI3, about 12 mol % of excess SnFa and about 24 mg Sn powder is needed to suppress the Sn oxidation. The solution is stirred at room temperature for about 6~10 hours and is filtered through a 0.45 hm filter before use. Before spin-coating the perovskite solation, the solution is cooled down to from about 0~5\u00b0 C. for about 5~10 min. Then, about 60 HL perovskite solutions are spin-coated onto the ITO/HTL at from about 1200 rpm for about 5~20 s, subsequently at from about 5500 rpm for about 40 s. About 200 pL anti-solvent chlorobenzene is slowly dripped onto the center of perov- skite film at about 9 s before the end of spin-coating. The as-prepared perovskite films are subsequently annealed on a hotplate at from about 110\u00b0 C. for about 30 min.\n\n[0157] The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spec- troscopy and corresponding Taue plot of FAu osEDA\u3002 ozSnls are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively, indicating the optimized tin perovskite has a bandgap of 1.39 eV. FIG. 3 shows the SEM of FA, 4,EDA, ,2Snl, perovskite film. The carrier mobility of FAu osEDA\u3002u 92Snl, is shown in FIG. 4, suggesting that the mobility of FAu 9;EDA, 92Snl; is higher than other widely used tin perovskites (FASnI, and PEA. 15FAu ssSJs), and indicating FAossEDAoo2Snls has strong carrier transport capability.\n\n[0158] For the C,,-BPy interface modified devices, Ceo- BPy powder is prepared and dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of from about 1.0 mg mL~'. The as-prepared solution is stirred at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) until the solution became clear. The solution is then transferred to a N,-filled glovebox before use. About 60 HL Ceo-BPy solution is spin-coated on top of the as-prepared perovskite layer at from about 5000 rpm for about 20 s, and next transferred to the hotplate and annealed at from about 75\u00b0 C. for about 3 min. The spin-coating processes are all conducted at room temperature (from about 20~25\u00b0 C.) in a N,-filled glovebox with the contents of O, and H,O<2 ppm.\n\n[0159] Next, about 25 nm C,, with an evaporating rate of from about 0.5 As~!, about 6 nm BCP at a rate of from about\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\n0.3 As-l and about 100 nm silver electrode at a rate of from about 2.0 As\u201c! are thermally evaporated, respectively, under high vacuum (<4x10-\u00b0 Torr).\n\n[0160] In the device configuration as depicted in FIG. 5, PEDOT:PSS and Ceo are used as the HTL and ETL, respec- tively. Tin perovskite is used as the light absorption layer; and Coo-BPy is used as the interlayer between the perovskite layer and Cuo layer.\n\n2. Effects of Ceo-BPy modification\n\n[0161] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to track the changes in the binding energy of the perovskite films with and without Ceo-BPy modification (i.e., after and before the step of depositing the C,,.-BPy interface layer as described above). In FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the binding energies corresponding to the Sn 3d and I 3d core levels of the Cao-BPy treated perovskite films shift marginally to lower values as compared to the control sample, indicating improved binding of both anions and cations on the perov- skite surface, which may be related to the strong binding between the perovskite surface ions and Ceo-BPy.\n\n[0162] Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is further performed to study the change of the characteristic peaks for Ceo-BPy molecule before and after depositing on perovskite films (FIG. 8). The C\u2014N bond in the pyridine group displayed stretching vibration at 1638 cm\u2122' for pris- tine Cgo-BPy, whereas shifted to 1627 cm for Cgo-BPy modified perovskite films. Except for the C\u2014N vibration, there is no discernible change in the other characteristic peaks.\n\n[0163] The XPS and FTIR results confirm that the pyri- dine unit in Coo-BPy as a Lewis base is able to combine with Sn ions in perovskite with a formation of Sn\u2014N bonding.\n\n[0164] In addition, the XRD patterns in FIG. 9 indicate that the crystal structure of the perovskite film does not change after Ceo-BPy modification, which shows no reac- tion of producing any impurity.\n\n[0165] To investigate the effect of Ceo-BPy on the trap- states at perovskite/ETL interface, the space-charge-limited- current (SCLC) measurements is conducted based on hole- only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA, 5EDAou 92Snl,/MoO3, Ag) and electron-only device (ITO/TiO,/FAg asEDAo. o2S8nl3/Cgo/Ag) as shown in FIG. 10 and FIG. 11. The method for preparing these two types of devices are known to the skilled persons. For example, references can be made to Zhen Li, et al., Organometallic-functionalized interfaces for highly efficient inverted perovskite solar cells, Science, Vol. 376, Issue 6591, pp. 416-420, 2022). The equation of Vyp,=eN 17/28 can be used to compute the trap density (N,), where L is the perovskite film thickness, \u00a2 is the relative dielectric constant, sois the vacuum permittivity, and V rrr is the trap-filling voltage. After Ceo-BPy modification, the hole trap density decreases from about 5.93x10'> cm7* to about 4.16x10!\u00b0 cm7%, and the electron trap density reduces from about 1.14x1015 cmr? to about 5.91x10'\u00b0 cm-3. The reduced hole and electron trap densities demon- strate that the defects at the perovskite/ETL interface of the devices have been suppressed via the modification of Ceo- BPy.\n\n[0166] The Urbach energy, which is the energetic disorder at the band edge, is further calculated using the formula a=d,exp(E/Eu), where a is the absorption coefficient, E is the photon energy, and Eu is the Urbach energy. As illus-\n\nUS 2024/0188420 Al\n\ntrated in FIG. 12, the FAoaeEDAooaSnIs perovskite film modified with Cso-BPy exhibits a sharper band edge than the pristine one.\n\n[0167] Moreover, the Eu is about 54 meV for the control sample, while reduces to about 38 meV for the Cuo-BPy modified film, which originates from the lower band edge energy disorder and trap density.\n\n[0168] To further elucidate the interface functionalization and understand the relationship between trap-state and charge recombination, light intensity dependent voltage measurements are performed as shown in FIG. 13. The correlation between Voc and light intensity (I) is Vo\u00a2=(nkT/ e)In(I/I>+1), where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltz- mamm constant, and T is the temperature. The slope of the fitted curve is connected with the ideality factor (n) in the form of nkBT/q, which can be used to assess trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination in PVSCs. The n value reduces from 1.85 to 1.72 as introducing the Ceo-BPy interlayer, indicating that trap-assisted SRH recombination is inhibited.\n\n[0169] FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 show the Atom force micros- copy (AFM) of the control and the Ceo-BPy treated perov- skite films. The perovskite grain size and morphology do not change when the Ceo-BPy interlayer is deposited. However, the surface contact potential of the Ceo-BPy functionalized perovskite film exhibits a decreased average value (-100 mV) relative to that of the control sample as shown in FIG. 16 to FIG. 19. The inventors attribute the reduced contact potential to the surface charge transfer induced by the interaction between C,,.-BPy and perovskite. Moreover, the Cao-BPy functionalized perovskite displays a smaller poten- tial distribution and surface potential difference (-200 mV) than that of the control sample (-350 mV). A uniform distribution of surface contact potential is believed to be beneficial for effective charge carrier extraction and non- radiative recombination inhibition at perovskite grain boundaries.\n\n[0170] The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) are conducted (FIG. 20 and FIG. 21) to further study the charge carrier kinetics at the perovskite/ETL interface (with a structure of glass/FAy osEDAoo2SnIs3/Ceo). The Ceo-BPy treated perov- skite film shows an obvious decreased intensity compared to the control sample. Moreover, the carrier lifetime of Ceo- BPy treated films obtained by fitting the TRPL spectra exhibits a reduction from about 8.67 ns to about 1.73 ns. The findings suggest that the Ceo-BPy functionalization can boost electron extraction at the perovskite/ETL interface.\n\n[0171] Accordingly, the energy level diagrams of the control and the C,o-BPy functionalized perovskite are dis- played in FIG. 22. Compared to the control one, a more \u201cn-type\u201d nature for C,o-BPy functionalized interface is verified because of the upshifted Fermi level relative to the vacuum band. This optimal energy level alignment can not only allow photogenerated electron to be extracted by the ETL with reduced energy loss, but also bounce back elec- trons at the interface.\n\n3. Performances of Cg -BPy modified photovoltaic devices\n\n[0172] The PVSCs are prepared with the method described above, with the only difference that different concentrations of Ceo-BPy (about 0 mg/mL, about 0.5 mg/mL, about 1.0 mg/mL, about 2.0 mg/mL) are used for producing the C,,-BPy interlayer. To verify the effect of Ceo-BPy interlayer on photovoltaic performance, the J-V\n\nJun. 6, 2024\n\nmeasurements are conducted on the tin PVSCs modified with different concentrations of Cso-BPy as shown in FIG. 23. The J-V characteristics of photovoltaic devices is con- ducted in a N,-filled glovebox at room temperature by using a Xenon lamp solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5, Taiwan). The power of the light is calibrated to 100 mW cm-2 by a silicon reference cell (with a KG2 filter). All the devices are measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a sweep mode of reverse scan (from 1.20 V to -0.01 V) and forward scan (from -0.01 V to 1.20 V) with the scan rate of 0.01 V s-1, and the delay time is 10 ms. The results indicate that each solar cell parameter improves when compared to the control device, and that the average PCE exhibits a tendency of growing initially and then dropping as the concentration of Ceo-BPy increases.\n\n[0173] In FIG. 24, the control PVSC exhibits a maximum PCE of about 12.29%, with an open-circuit voltage (Yoc) of about 0.753 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of about 22.73 mA cm\u201d? and a fill factor (FF) of about 71.8%. As compared to the control device, the C,.-BPy interlayer (about 1.0 mg mL-0 functionalized device shows an enhanced PCE of about 14.14%, with a Yoc of about 0.820 V, a Isc of about 23.45 mA/cm? and an FF of about 73.1%.\n\n[0174] The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the champion device (a concentration of Ceo-BPy of about 1.0 mg mL\") in FIG. 25 produces integrated J... with a minor difference from the value obtained from the J-V measurements. The Ceo-BPy functionalized device is also measured at the maximum power point (MPP) to obtain a stabilized photocurrent of about 20.45 mA cm\u2122 and a stabilized PCE of about 13.50%. (FIG. 26).\n\n[0175] To investigate the stability of the tin PVSCs with the Cuo-BPy interface modification (about 1.0 mg mL~'), the PCE of the unencapsulated devices is recorded under the continuous illumination condition (AM 1.5 G simulated solar light) and heating condition (about 80\u00b0 C.) and in N., respectively, and the PCE evolutions are depicted in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28. The Ceo-BPy treated devices show excellent light stability with about 95.3% initial PCE retained after 1000 hours. In contrast, the PCE of the control devices degraded to about 75.2%. In addition, for the heating sta- bility shown in FIG. 28, the Cgo-BPy treated PVSC maintained>about 80% initial PCE after 1000 hours aging, while the PCE of the control device decayed to about 60%.\n\n[0176] To demonstrate the unique effect of Ceo-BPy inter- face modification on tin PVSCs, the inventors compare the efliciencies of tin and lead PVSCs treated with and without Co-BPy. As can be seen from the comparison of normalized efficiencies in FIG. 29, the introduction of Ceo-BPy can significantly improve the efficiency of tin PVSCs; on the contrary, the introduction of Cso-BPy into lead PVSCs only slightly improves the efficiency.\n\n[0177] It should be understood that the above only illus- trates and describes examples whereby the present invention may be carried out, and that modifications and/or alterations may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.\n\n[0178] It should also be understood that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combi- nation in a single embodiment.
