More specifically, the present invention relates to a yolk-shell nanostructure and methods for pre- paring the same.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0002] Electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen pow- ered by using renewable energy sources, instead of fossil fuels, is widely considered as one of the promising high energy density carriers for clean power in future. Up until now, platinum (Pt)-based nanomaterials have served as the most effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reac- tion (HER) due to their hydrogen adsorption free energy (AG;,) being close to zero, requiring only a small overpo- tential to produce hydrogen. However, the poor stability and unsatisfactory performance of Pt in non-acidic conditions greatly hinders its widespread practical application. For example, the HER kinetics of Pt in alkaline solutions is about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic conditions.\n\n[0003] Because of different requirements in different elec- trolyzer systems (e.g., acidic media for poton-exchange membrane-based water electrolyzers, near-neutral media for microbial electrolysis cells and alkaline medium for alkaline electrolyzers), as well as the intense local pH change on the electrode surface during reaction, an effective HER electro- catalyst must perform well over a wide pH range. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop pH-uni- versal electrocatalysts with high electrochemical perfor- mance and robust stability, even in terms of the current density calculated based on geometric surface (electrode surface area), very few of them can achieve comparable activities to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. In this regard, it is still challenging to develop pH-universal electrocata- lysts with HER activities and stability that exceed those of commercial Pt/C materials.\n\n[0004] Recent studies have found that rhodium (Rh)-based nanomaterials may replace Pt to serve as another promising candidate for pH-universal HER electrocatalysts. For example, Guo et al. reported the preparation of monodis- perse Rh,P nanoparticles via a colloidal method, in which the nanoparticles showed excellent HER performance in a wide pH range. In addition, Du et al. used a laser ablation method to synthesize compressed RhO, clusters embedded in Rh nanoparticles; the catalysis performance indicated that Rh-based noble metals are superior for alkaline HER. Nev- ertheless, the preparation methods/techniques employed in the aforementioned are complex, time-consuming, and expensive.\n\n[0005] Thus, there is a need in the art to develop an improved nanostructure and a simple, low-cost, and scalable method for fabricating such nanostructure. The present invention addresses this need.\n\n[0006] The following reference list sets forth the literature mentioned in this section, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety:\n\n[0007] 1.

Unless otherwise defined, all other technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs.\n\n[0062] In order to address the objectives and needs dis- cussed above, the present invention provides a yolk-shell nanostructure with Rh nanoparticles embedded in S, N co-doped carbon nanostructures for efficient hydrogen evo- lution reactions. The preparation process of the Rh,/NSC YSS (x=5, 10, 15, 20, or 30) is conducted with a self- template method. The Rh/NSC YSS precursor is first obtained with the nanostructure through a facile hydrother- mal method by using RhCl and thiourea as the Rh, N, S and C sources. Then, the precursor is in-situ transformed into Rh/NSC YSS nanostructure by a heat treatment in air atmosphere.\n\n[0063] The obtained nanostructures can achieve an over- potential of 10-20 mV at 10 mA cm\u201d, a Tafel slope of 20-30 mV dec\u2122', high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.1-0.3 s~! (at -75 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), and long-term durability for more than 10 hours, which is the record-high alkaline HER activity among the ever-reported noble metal- based catalysts.\n\n[0064] Preferably, the obtained nanostructures has an overpotential of 13.5 mV at 10 mA cm~?, a Tafel slope of 25.5 mV dec\", high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.143 s~* (at -75 m V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode).\n\n[0065] In some embodiments, the yolk-shell nanostructure has a particle size of 1-300 nm, more particularly, 30-250 mm. The water contact angle is between 10 to 40 degrees, more particularly, between 10 to 20 degrees. A thickness of the yolk-shell nanostructure may be in the range of 1 to 10 nm.\n\n[0066] The methods for fabricating the yolk-shell nano- structures are low-cost, simple, and reproduceable, making them suitable for large-scale production. The method involves precipitating the nanomaterials followed by heat treatment. In a first aspect, a rhodium salt such as RhCl: is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as water. A separate thiourea solution is formed; similarly, the thiourea may use water as the solvent. and thiourea in distilled water sepa- rately to form a RhC1, solution and a thiourea solution\n\n[0067] The rhodium salt solution is slowly added to the thiourea solution with agitation to obtain a transparent mixture. A hydrothermal reaction is performed on the mix- ture, followed by cooling to room temperature, causing the formation of precipitates. The precipitates are recovered and. washed, followed by drying for at least approximately 12 hours, preferably under vacuum conditions. The precipi- tates, which typically exhibit a brown color, a transformed into a yolk-shell nanostructure through heat treatment in the ambient atmosphere.\n\n[0068] In one aspect, the mass ratio between RhCl, and thiourea is in a range of 15:1 to 2:1 and the temperature\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nduring the hydrothermal reaction is in a range of 120\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C. The time of the hydrothermal reaction is in a range of 1 to 48 hours.\n\n[0069] In one embodiment, the drying of the precipitates may be overnight and under vacuum at a temperature of approximately 50\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. The heat treatment may occur at a temperature of approximately 300\u00b0 C. to 800\u00b0 C. and for a time of 1 to 48 hours. To reach the final heat treatment temperature, the temperature may increase at a rate of approximately 2\u00b0 C. min@' until the final heat treatment temperature is reached.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nExample 1\u2014Fabrication of Rh, ,/NSC Yolk-Shell Nanostructures (Rh, ;/NSC YSS)\n\n[0070] 15 mg ofRhCl and 2 g of thiourea were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water, respectively. The RhCl, solution was then added to the thiourea solution slowly under stirring until the clear transparent solution was obtained. The mix- ture solution was sealed into a 35 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave reactor, which was next heated at 140\u00b0 C. for 12 hours in an electric oven. After cooling the system to room temperature naturally, the brown precipitates were gathered and washed several times with ethanol and deion- ized water by centrifugation, followed by vacuum dried at 60\u00b0 C. overnight. Finally, the Rh,;/NSC yolk-shell nano- structures (Rh,,/NSC YSS) were transformed from brown precipitates by a heat treatment method in air atmosphere at 450\u00b0 C. for 6 hours with a heating rate of 2\u00b0 C. min- (FIG. 1).\n\n[0071] For comparison, other Rh,/NSC YSS (x=5, 10, 20 and 30) were also prepared as control samples using the same methods except for changing the feeding amount of RhCl, for 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively.\n\nExample 2\u2014Assessment of the Crystallinity and Structure of Rh, ,/NSC YSS\n\n[0072] The purity and crystalline structure of prepared samples were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a scan rate of 0.05\u00b0 s~! in a 20 scan ranging from 20\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 using a Bruker D2 Phaser (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) instrument equipped with a monochromatic Cu-Ka radiation.\n\n[0073] Referring to FIG. 2, as illustrated in the XRD pattern, the crystallographic structure of the obtained Rhis/ NSC YSS could be matched well with the standard pattern of cubic Rh phase (ICPDS NO. 87-0714). When combined with FT-IR spectra, it can be seen that the sharp peak around. 611 cm\u2122! is caused by Rh\u2014S(O), indicating the strong electronic effect between Rh and S, N co-doped carbon.\n\n[0074] The morphology and dimension of obtained prod- ucts were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom Pro, Phenom-World, The Netherlands) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and field-emission SEM (SU-8010, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating volt- age of 15 kV. The SEM image of Rh,;/NSC YSS was shown in FIG. 3A. The results showed that the average size of the prepared Rh, ./NSC YSS was 145.1+4.4 nm (FIG. 3B), and the shell thickness of the prepared Rh,./NSC YSS was 7.7+0.1 nm (FIG. 3C).\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\n[0075] In addition, the interior structure of as obtained Rh,;/NSC YSS was further elucidated by transmission elec- tron microscopy (TEM) (FIG. 3D). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image showed a representative interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm, suggesting the association with (111) plane of the cubic Rh phase. In ddition to (111) plane, several atomic layers of RhO, (with he lattice spacing of 0.17 nm corresponding to (211) plane \u4eba RhO,, JCPDS NO. 43-1026) was also observed on the surface of Rh,;/NSC YSS (FIG. 3E). ome\n\n0076] Moreover, the high-angle annular dark field HAADF) STEM image clearly proved the porosity and heterogeneity of the nanostructure. It was obvious in FIG. 3F that the core of the nanostructure has a higher Rh content compared to the shell. Elemental mappings of the Rh, ,/NSC YSS indicates that C, Rh, S and N elements are unevenly distributed on the surface. mars\n\nExample 3\u2014Effect of Changing the Mass Ratio of RhCl and Thiourea\n\n[0077] By adjusting the precursor ratio during the prepa- ration process, various yolk-shell nanostructures can be prepared. In one embodiment of the present invention, Rh,/NSC and Rh,,/NSC nanostructures were prepared by changing the mass ratio between RhCls and thiourea (FIG. 4). Rh;/NSC and Rh,,/NSC nanostructures were prepared. by using the same methods in Example 1 except for chang- ing the feeding amount of RhCl, for 5 mg and 30 mg, respectively. The result showed that the crystallographic structure of the Rh,/NSC or Rh,,/NSC nanostructures could be matched well with the standard pattern of cubic Rh phase (JCPDS NO. 87-0714).\n\n[0078] In another embodiment, FIG. 5A showed that Rhs/ NSC YSS exhibited a typical sphere-like nanoparticle (NP) morphology with a size of 290+1.9 nm. The HRTEM image and corresponding EDS mapping revealed that the Rh atoms are evenly distributed on the N, S co-doped carbon surface (FIGS. 5B and 5C). When the Rh content was increased, the HRTEM image and corresponding EDS mapping suggested that the increased Rh content did not change the chemical composition of the product (FIGS. 5E and 5F). However, porous nanoparticles (PP) with a size of 42.5+0.7 nm were obtained (FIG. 5D).\n\n[0079] When the Rh/C ratio was increased, the particle size would decrease exponentially. The relationship between particle size and Rh/C ratio was showed in FIG. 6A. It should be noted here, when the Rh/C ratio is 5 (Rh, )/NSC) and 10 (Rh,,/NSC), the prepared nanostructures still show the yolk-shell structure. Comparing FIGS. 6B and 6C, it can be seen that when the Rh/C ratio is increased from 5 (Rhjo/NSC) to 10 (Rh4o/NSC), the average particle size is decreased by about 38% to 136.4+4.1 nm, and the thickness is decreased by about 62% to 6.9+0.1 nm.\n\nExample 4\u2014Mechanism of Forming Rhx/NSC YSS\n\n[0080] Based on the above characterization, FIG. 7 showed the possible formation mechanism of Rh,/NSC YSS (x=5, 10, 15, 20, or 30):\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\n[0081] \u4eba When the Rh/C mass ratio is low, the copo- lymerization reaction between Rh** ions and thiourea dominates the reaction, and the reaction process is as follows:\n\ns NH \u4eba sw \u2014 \u00a7 IN NI ah | \u4e00 C | \u4e00 N H\n\nIn this case, thiourea can get into carbon nanospheres in the presence of Rh** ions under high temperature and pressure until the Rh** ions are consumed completely. If only thio- urea participates in the hydrothermal reaction during this process, no product will be obtained.\n\n[0082] (ii) When the Rh/C mass ratio increases, Rh>* ions tend to perform homogeneous nucleation because of the positive redox potential of Rh**. Therefore, in the initial stage, the homogeneous nucleation of Rh** ions dominate the reaction. When Rh?* ions are con- tinuously consumed and drop to a critical value, the remaining Rh** ions and thiourea repeat the stage I and proceed copolymerization reaction on the surface of the core via Rh\u2014S bonds to form the Rh/NSC shell. Finally, under heat treatment, compared with the shell with low Rh/NSC mass ratio, the evaporation rate and volatile products of the core are more pronounced, leading to the generation of voids and the formation of Rh/NSC yolk-shell structure.\n\n[0083] (iii) If the Rh/C mass ratio keeps increasing, the homogeneous nucleation of Rh?+ ions dominates the reaction in the whole process. Thiourea would then participate in the reaction through copolymerization with Rh** ions and acts as a structural indicator. Thus, after high-temperature carbonization treatment, a porous nanostructure is formed.\n\nExample 5\u2014HER Electrocatalytic Performance of Rh,;/NSC YSS\n\n[0084] By using a typical three electrode system, the HER electrocatalytic performance of Rh,,/NSC YSS was next evaluated. For comparison, the data collected on Rh,/NSC YSS, RhswNSC YSS, commercial 20% Pt/C and commer- cial 5% Rh/C (C\u2014Rh/C) were also included. Table 1 summarized the overpotential and Tafel Slope of various electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Among these five samples, Rh,;/NSC YSS exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance in the 1M KOH electrolyte (pH=14), with the lowest overpotential (13.5 mV at 10 mA cm7) and Tafel slope (24.9 mV dec\u2122'), which was better than those of commercial 20% Pt/C and outperforming the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts (FIGS. 8A and 8B). Referring to FIG. 8C, Rh, ./NSC YSS achieved the highest TOF of 0.143 s7' at the overpotential of 75 mV, which was also larger than those of Pt/C (0.131 s- and C \u4e00 Rh/C (0.075 s\u201c*).\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nTABLE 1\n\nElectrocatalytic performance comparison between Rh,/NSC YSS (x =\n\n5, 15, 30) and state-of-the-art noble metal based electrocatalysts Overpotential (mV) Tafel Slope Catalysts G=10mAcm\u2122~) (mV dee\u201c) Electrolyte Reference Rhys/NSC 13 24.9 1M KOH This work RhyNSC 17 25.5 1M KOH This work RhaoNSC 20 26.2 1M KOH This work Commercial PUC 17 36.6 1M KOH This work RuC2N 17 38 1M KOH Mozde Nanotechnology, 2017, 12, 441.

B, 2019 257,117905\n\n[0085] Furthermore, the Rh,;/NSC YSS also displayed long-term stability with a degradation rate of 147.5% during 10 hours, which was better than the ones of PU/C (161.7%) and C\u2014Rh/C (150.0%), verifying the promotion effect of yolk-shell nanostructure to stabilize architectural morphol- ogy and effectively avoids the coverage of active sites during reaction (FIG. 8D).\n\n[0086] The above data have proved that hydrogen binding energy (HBE) provides a key descriptor for HER activity. The enhanced HER intrinsic activity of Rh,/NSC YSS can be ascribed to a weaker H chemisorption strength as com- pared to Pt/C, triggering the acceleration of the hydrogen desorption step.\n\n[0087] Also, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that when the Rh/C mass ratio was increased, the percentage of oxidized Rh (located at 309.8 eV and 314.8 eV) improved obviously (FIG. 8E), indicating that the\n\nelectronic structure of active sites can be controlled via changing the Rh/C mass ratio.\n\n[0088] Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectros- copy (EIS) analyses of the nanostructures have been employed to further understand the reaction kinetics for HER with equivalent circuit depicted in FIG. 8F. R, is the overall series resistance. CPE, and R, are the constant phase element and resistance describing electron transport at sub- strate/catalyst interface, respectively. CPE,, is the constant phase element of the catalyst/electrolyte interface, and R,,,, is the mass-transfer resistance at catalyst/electrolyte inter- face. The semicircles in the high-frequency range and low- frequency range are associated with charge-transfer resis- tance (R,,) and mass-transfer resistance (R,,,,), respectively. The elements of the value in the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table 2. Among these three samples, it can be seen that Rh,./NSC YSS exhibits the lowest R., (8.372) and R,,,, (1.74), indicating a faster HER process.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nValues of the elements in the equivalent circuit Catalysts Rhy/NSC NP Rhys/NSC \u4e86\u3002 Q R @) ems) 2 \u00a9 Qa Gems\") ay \u4eba 3.96 1.38 x 105 0.69 6.39 6.1 x 10-3 1.23 2.41 3.87 556x104 0.76 4.50 15 x 10? 1.00 1.74\n\nYSS\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\nTABLE 2-continued\n\nValues of the elements in the equivalent circuit R, Q Ri Qu Catalysts (@) (Fen2.sS nm (OO :en2.S\u201c 0 35x104 078 868 71x103 RhawNSC 4.20 PP 0.92\n\nNote:\n\nthe charge-transfer resistance (R,,) = the sum of R, and R, in the equivalent circuit.\n\nExample 5\u2014Effect on Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA)\n\n[0089] To evaluate the electrochemical surface area of the prepared nanostructures, the electrochemical double-layer capacitances (C,,) of the products were measured via a simple cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, and therefore the electrochemical surface area can be estimated according to the following formula:\n\nECSA = Caz Cs\n\nCs means specific capacitance; and Cur means capacitance. In the present invention, Cs is the same value for all three samples. Thus, ECSA changes can be compared from Cz. As shown in FIG. 9, the Rh,./NSC YSS exhibits the largely increased ECSA, which can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of the Rh active centers.\n\nExample 6\u2014Electrocatalytic Performance of Rh,;/NSC YSS Across all pH Ranges\n\n[0090] An ideal HER electrocatalyst should possess excel- lent performance over a wide pH value, even at all pH values. FIG. 10 records the overpotential (current density is 10 mA cm\u2122\u201d) and corresponding Tafel slopes of the elec- trocatalysts in the whole pH range. In specific, Rh,,/NSC YSS shows a faster kinetic process than that of Pt/C in all the electrolyte of different pH values. Therefore, even in the strong acid condition (pH=0.36 and 1.08) where the over- potential of Rh,;/NSC YSS exceeds that of Pt/C, Rh,;/NSC YSS still exhibits a higher electrocatalytic performance than PC.\n\nExample 7 \u4e00 Hydrophilicity of Different Rh,/NSC YSS\n\n[0091] Water and gas physics Contact Ange contact angle were tested by Data- Tester. In addition to having improved electrocatalytic performance, the Rh,./NSC YSS also exhibits the best hydrophilicity among three kinds of nanostructures, which can be contributed to the existence of capillary force in the small voids. The capillary force would significantly improve the electrolyte infiltration into the voids compared with NP and PP nanostructures, resulting in a smaller contact angle with electrolytes (FIG. HA). Also, the Rh,;/NSC YSS exhibits the excellent aerophobicity, which is beneficial for the Hz desorption (FIG. 11B).\n\nExample 8\u2014Gas Bubbles Release Behavior of Different Rh,/NSC YSS\n\n[0092] To gain a further insight into the effect of nano- structures on the HER performance, the gas bubbles release\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\nRane (0)\n\n5.47\n\nbehavior is further investigated during the in-situ electro- chemical process. Taking the HER recorded at -0.05 V (vs RHE) as an example, hydrogen bubbles escaped easily from the Rh,./NSC YSS surface with a size of 28.7\u00a30.1 nm that are obviously smaller than those of Rh,/NSC YSS NP (36.0\u00a32.7 nm) and Rh3,/NSC YSS PP (61.242.1 nm) (FIG. 11C).\n\n[0093] This phenomenon is closely related to the gas bubbles nucleation, transfer and desorption process. Spe- cifically, for the Rh./NSC YSS NP electrocatalyst, typical gas bubbles behavior is occurred on the surface. The bubbles nucleate and grow on the active sites, and after reaching the critical size, they will directly desorb and diffuse into the electrolyte (FIG. 11D, top).\n\n[0094] While for the Rh,;/NSC YSS, compared with the larger bubbles generating on the outer shell, more gas bubbles are quickly generated and restricted on the surface of the core part because of the spatial confinement effect and heterogeneous composition. Based on the Young-Laplace equation:\n\nPs = 2y/R,\n\nP, presents the pressure and R is the radius of curvature, the pressure of a bubble is inversely proportional to its radius. The small gas bubbles inside can diffuse into the large bubbles easily through the shell because of the pressure difference, then bubbles on the outside will be quickly released. The ion transfer rate is positively correlated to the rate of gas escape; hence, the rapid desorption of gas bubbles for Rh,,/NSC YSS is beneficial for accelerating the catalytic reaction (FIG. 11D, middle).\n\n[0095] For the Rhao/NSC YSS, the generated gas bubbles are easily trapped in the porous channel. covering the active sites and reducing the catalytic performance (FIG. 11D, bottom).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nElectrochemical Measurements:\n\n[0096] For electrochemical measurement, the well-dis- persed catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonication with 3 mg of fabricated electrocatalyst, 50 HL of distilled water, 170 uL of ethanol, 10 pL of Nafion for 2 hours. Then, 5 hL of the catalyst ink was pipetted onto the glass carbon electrode surface (5 mm in diameter, S=0.19625 cm\u201d). All electro- chemical characterization was investigated with a Gamry 300 electrochemical workstation connected with a standard three-electrode configuration under 25\u00b0 C. using a constant temperature bath. The fabricated electrode sample was used as the working electrode. A saturated calomel electrode\n\nUS 2024/0229263 Al\n\n(SCE) and a carbon rod were employed as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. All the reported potentials were calibrated versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation of Egur=Escet(0.2415+0.059xpH) V. where Ep;;- is the potential referred to RHE and E,.., is the measured potential against the SCE reference electrode. The electrochemical activity of the samples towards HER and OER were sur- veyed in IM KOH aqueous solution (pH=14) by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s 1. To keep the electrode surface in a relatively stable state, several cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles were operated before the assessment of electrochemical activity until the hydrogen evolution currents showed the unnoticeable change. Unless otherwise mentioned, the voltammograms were recorded with the iR drop compensation automatically on the work- station. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 1.5 V (vs. RHE) over a frequency range of between 0.05 Hz and 100 kHz at 5 mV s\n\nCalculation of TOF:\n\n[0097] Turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated from the equation of\n\nIxA TOR = 2xFxn\u2019\n\nwhere I is the current density, A is the exposed surface area of the electrocatalyst, F is the Faradic constant and n is the moles of the active materials. Herein, the noble metal atoms for each catalyst loaded on the glass carbon electrode are considered as active sites.\n\nPreparation of Electrolytes:\n\n[0098] The electrolyte was prepared as follows; as seen from the electrolytes below, all pH values from alkaline to acidic are covered in the present invention:\n\n0.5 M H)S0, (pH = 0.36),\n\n0.05 M HSO + 0.45 M NaSO, (pH = 1.08), 5 mM HSO4 + 0.49 M Naz$O, (pH = 1.88), 0.5 mM H;$04+0.49 MNa2SO4 (pH = 2.88), 0.05 mM HSO4 + 0.49M Na2SO4 (pH = 3.91), 5 mM H$0, + 0.49M NaySOy (pH = 4.95), 0.5 mM HSO4 + 0.49 M NajSOj (pH = 5.79), 0.5 MNazSOy (pH = 6.8), 1 MKOH (pH = 14), 0.1 MKOH+0.6 MK2SO4 (pH = 13.05), 0.01 MKOH + 0.66 MK,SO, (pH = 12.14), 1 mM KOH + 0.66 MK $0j (pH = 10.75), 0.1 mM KOH + 0.66 MK2SO4 (pH = 10.12), 0.01 mMKOH + 0.66 MK2SO4 (pH = 9.04), 1 mMKOH + 0.66 MK2SO4 (pH = 8.28).\n\n0.05 mM HSO4 + 0.49M Na2SO4 (pH = 3.91),\n\nJul. 11, 2024\n\n[0099] The description of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description.
